"Two voices are there." From the inmost breast,
    Its seat oracular, the one proceeds,
    Prompting the highborn soul to worthy deeds,
And rousing Fancy from inglorious rest.
The other from above, Heaven's high behest
    In still small accents speaks; which he who heeds,
    Is wise, for sure the path where Duty leads,
Though dark, is safe; though rugged, yet the best.
Nor would I at the call of Pleasure dare
    Resist that voice, but rather wait resigned,
Perform my daily task with duteous care,
    And quench the proud aspirings of my mind;
Till happier days arrive, when, blithe and free,
My soul shall spread her wings in joyful liberty.
