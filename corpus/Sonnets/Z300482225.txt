You, whose dull spirits feel not the fine glow
    Enthusiasm breathes, no more of light
    Perceive you in rapt Poesy, though' bright
    In Fancy's richest colouring, than can flow
From jeweled treasures in the central night
    Of their deep caves. -- You have no sun to show
    Their inborn radiance pure. -- Go, snarlers, go;
    Nor your defects of feeling, and of sighed,
To charge upon the Poet thus presume,
    Ye lightless minds, whatever of title proud,
    Scholar, or Sage, or Critic, you assume,
Arraigning his high claims with censure loud,
    Or sickly scorn; yours, yours is all the cloud,
    Gems cannot sparkle in the midnight gloom.
