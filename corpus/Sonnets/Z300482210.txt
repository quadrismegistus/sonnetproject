By Derwent's rapid stream as oft I strayed,
    With Infancy's light step and glances wild,
    And saw vast rocks, on steepy mountains piled,
    Frown over that' umbrageous glen; or pleased surveyed
The cloudy moonshine in the shadowy glade,
    Romantic Nature to that' enthusiast child
    Grew dearer far than when serene she smiled,
    In uncontrasted loveliness arrayed.
But O! in every scene, with sacred sway,
    Her graces fire me; from the bloom that spreads
    Resplendent in the lucid morn of May,
To the green light the little glowworm sheds
    On mossy banks, when midnight glooms prevail,
    And softest silence brood's over all the dale.
