When pensive on that portraiture I gaze,
    Where my four brother's round about me stand,
    And four fair sisters smile with graces bland,
The goodly monument of happier days;

And think, how soon insatiate death, who preys
    On all, has cropped the rest with ruthless hand,
    While only I survive of all that band,
Which one chaste bed did to my father raise;

It seems, that Like a column left alone,
    The tottering remnant of some splendid fane,
        'Scap'd from the fury of the barbarous Gaul,
And wasting Time, which has the rest overthrown,
    Amidst our house's ruins I remain,
        Single, unpropped, and nodding to my fall.
