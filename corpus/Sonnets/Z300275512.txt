When Charles from us withdraws his glorious light,
The Sun desires his absence to supply:
    And that we may nothing in darkness lie,
He strives to free the North from dreadful night.
Yet we to Ph≈ìbus scarce erect our sighed,
    But all our looks, our thoughts to Charles apply,
    And in the best delights of life we die,
Till he return, and make this Climate bright.
    Now he ascends and gives Apollo leave
To driven his Horses to the lower part,
    VVe by his presence Like content receive,
As when fresh spirits aid the fainting heart.
    Rest here (great Charles) and shine to us alone,
    For other Stars are common; Charles our own.
