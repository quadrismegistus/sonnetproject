I ask no hundred days exempt from pain,
        For I have seen here Christ upon His rood -- 
        I, who 'neath stars of Bethlehem have stood,
Drunk Nazareth's well, by Galilee's blue plain
Of sparkling waters wandered, and was fain
        To weep at Olivet, in solemn mood
        Have climbed, Varallo, through thy holy wood,
And seen hate's loss and love's eternal gain.

What Caimi planned and grave Gaudenzio drew
    Shall moulder in each iron-grated cell,
        And Borromeo's skull shall grin no more;
        But long as Mastelone's waters roar,
    The faith that built compassion's citadel
Shall on these heights her eagle's wings renew.
