Sweet are the charms of shamefaced Modesty,
    When, coily shy of well deserved applause,
    She veils her blushing cheek, and meek withdraws
From general notice and the public eye;

But therefore shall exalted worth still lie
    Lost in oblivion? This the sacred laws
    Of Justice, the regard to Virtue's cause,
And honour of the lovely Sex deny;

Wherefore are given the Muse-inspired lays,
    The Poet's lofty sung, but to rehearse
The fair deserts of passed or present days,
And bashful merit's doubting eye to raise?
    Ill he deserves the powers of tuneful verse,
Who can see Virtue, and forbear to praise.
