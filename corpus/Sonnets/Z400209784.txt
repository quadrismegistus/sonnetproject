My thoughts through yours refracted into speech
transmute this room musically tonight,
the notes of contact flowing, rhythmic, bright
with and informal art beyond my single reach.
Outside, dark birds fly in a greening time   :
wings of our sistered wishes beat these walls   :
and words afflict our minds in near footfalls
approaching with a latening hour's chime.

And if and essential thing has flown between us,
rare intellectual bird of communication,
let us seize it quickly   :   let our preference
choose it instead of softer things to screen us
each from the other's self   :   muteness or hesitation,
nor petrify live miracle by our indifference.
