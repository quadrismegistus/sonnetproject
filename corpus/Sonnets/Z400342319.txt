Is't not enough (aye me) me thus to see
Like some Heauen-banish'd Ghost still wailing go?
A Shadow which your Rayes do only show,
To vex me more, unless ye bid me die?
What could ye worse allot unto your Foe?
But die will I, so ye will not deny
That Grace to me which mortal Foes even try,
To choose what sort of Death should end my Woe.
One Time I found when as ye did me kiss,
Yee gave my panting Soul so sweet a Touch,
That half I sowned in amid of all my Blisse,
I do but crave my Deaths Wound may be such:
    For though by Grief I die not and Annoy,
    Is't not enough to die through too much Joy?
