While Age and Avarice, with malignant eye,
    Forbid gay Hymen robbed in saffron train,
    With glittering torch to led thee to the fane,
Where Love awaits to bind the nuptial tie;
To sooth thy cares a group of Muses fly,
    Warbling from varied lyres a varied strain.
Verse has and opiate charm for amorous pain,
    And spells, Like magic, lurk in minstrelsy.
With these conjoined accept this friendly lay,
    Which truth inspires, and pure affection warms,
From Him, who saw thy infant bloom display
    What now, in full maturity of charms,
Expands, to crown the long-expected day
    That yields those beauty's to a husband's arms.
