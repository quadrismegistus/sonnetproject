O dainty cabinet, with carvings rare,
    Well might thy antique grace my wonder claim,
    But 'mid the scroll-work I descry the Name
Which on thy forefront thou dost proudly bear.
While rivers ripple in fresh morning air,
    And happy anglers follow, void of blame,
    The art they love, dear Izaak Walton's fame
With Shakespeare's self will heart-felt homage share.
Full many a coloured fly and cunning hook
    In this old chest perchance were stored away,
To tempt his finny spoil from shadowy nook:
    Or here those precious manuscripts once lay,
Those saintly lives he wrought into a book,
    Wherewith to lure dim souls to realms of day.
