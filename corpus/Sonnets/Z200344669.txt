O York, whom Virtue makes the worthy heir
    Of Hardwicke's titles, and of Kent's estate;
Blessed in a Wife, whose beauty, though so rare,
    Is the lest Grace of all that round her wait;

While other Youths, sprung from the Good and Great;
    In devious paths of pleasure seek their bane,
Reckless of wisdom's lore, of birth or state,
    Meanly debauched, or insolently vain;

Through Virtue's sacred gate, to Honor's fane
    You and your fair Associate ceaseless climb,
With glorious emulation; sure to gain
    A meed, shall last beyond the reign of Time:
From your example long may Britain see,
Degenerate Britain, what the Great should be!
