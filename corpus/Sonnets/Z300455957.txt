Dark heaves the wave along the lonely strand,
    The cowering sea-mew droops her dusky wing,
    The plover, circling, seeks a safer land,
    While to their rocky cove the swallows cling:
Clouds, thickly-driving, veil the face of day;
    And now the gathering tempest raves more near,
    High over the beach froths up the spumy spray,
    And even at noon the shades of night appear.
Yet do these horrors with congenial gloom
    Paint the sad tale yond sister-spires record
    Of two found spirits, whose distressful doom
Ingenuous Feeling sweetly hath deplored,
    And to the eye of sympathy restored
    From dark Tradition's legendary tome.
