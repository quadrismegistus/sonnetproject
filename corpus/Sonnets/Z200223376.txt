It must be the whole world doubt you think,
books on the edge of the table,
window, and across the street brownstone houses
Like more books waiting to be read.
Eat everything on the plate, wash the dishes
spread out the ratty tarot cards and listen.
Further down in you than the tortellini fell
a congress of deceptions practices truth.
Listen, if we sat here after a big dinner
watching the sun fall into Jersey for a thousand years
it would never stop talking down in there.
And that's just the beginning isnt it,
since even these words we finally gasp out
are just scraps of a word you can almost remember.
