And banished I am if but from thee.
O lovely Maid, whose bosom knows no guile!
    Enchanting fair, that robs me of my rest!
Fond Fancy traces oft thy heavenly smile,
    Which raised a passion in this peaceful breast.
Tho' distant from the place I hold so dear,
    I never forget those joys I knew of late;
    But, Like the dove who mourns his absent mate,
Pining in grief, love prompts the painful tear.
Lonely I range the briary woods along,
    Where Nature's wildness charmed my infant view;
Pensive I hear at noon the woodlark's sung -- 
    Still busy Memory paints our last adieu;
For what avails to me the beauty's of the grove,
