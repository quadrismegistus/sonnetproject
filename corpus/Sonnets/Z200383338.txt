Is trust betrayed, does kindness grow unkind?
    Can beauty (both at once) give life and kill?
Shall fortune altar the most constant mind?
    Will reason yield unto rebelling will?
Doth fancy purchase praise, and virtue shame?
    May show of goodness lurk in treachery?
Hath truth unto her self procured blame?
    Must sacred Muses suffer misery?
Are women woe to men, traps for their falls?
    Differ their words, their deeds, their looks, their lives?
Have lovers ever been their tennis-balls?
    Be husbands fearful of the chastest wives?
All men do these affirm, and so must I:
Unless Fidessa give to me the lie.
