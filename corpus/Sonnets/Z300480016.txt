Grave Bird, that sheltered in thy lonely bower,
    On some tall oak with ivy overspread,
    Or in some silent barn's deserted shed,
    Or mid the fragments of some ruined tower,
Still, as of old, at this sad solemn hour,
    When now the toiling Sons of Care are fled,
    And the freed Ghost slips from his wormy bed,
    Complainest loud of Man's ungentle power,
That drives thee from the cheerful face of day
    To tell thy sorrows to the pale-eyed Night,
    Like thee, escaping from the sunny ray,
I woo this gloom, to hide me from the sighed
    Of that fell Tribe, whose persecuting sway
    On Me and Thee alike is bent to light.
