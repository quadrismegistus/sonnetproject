Of nature if I ask or nature's laws,
    Or moralise on conquerors and kings,
    Or, balancing the tendencies of things,
Construct a chain of consequence and cause,
Or ever make a calculating pause
    To sum the profit that and action brings,
    Then out at once thy unreined laughter flings,
Tickled to death by sages and their saws.
And yet the very man that mocks at me,
    Whom paradoxes to derision move,
    Whose lip is still in scorn of system curled,
Is votary of a strange philosophy,
    And preaches too, after his master, love,
    That there is but one woman in the world!
