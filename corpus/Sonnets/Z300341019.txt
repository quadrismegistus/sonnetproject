Although the silent sadness of thine air,
    Thy mild blue eyes, to earth serenely bent, -- 
    (Eyes that soft, melting Pity might have lent,
Or Resignation, dovelike virgin, wear);
Altho' the prisoned ringlets of thy hair,
    In studied but yet modest ornament
    (The unobtrusive neatness of content),
Thy cheek, one knows not if 'this pale or fair;
Thy plaintive melody of voice, but chief
That evenness of soul, that seems to turn
    A placid eye on all, my soul so draws,
No sighs of mine shall violate thy grief,
    For o! so much I love to see thee mourn,
    That, for a world, I would not give thee cause!
