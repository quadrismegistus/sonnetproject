Benson! in thee there dwells and holy calm
    Which pure religion can alone inspire;
    Thy chastened manners wear and outward charm
    That speaks a soul sublimed by virtue's fire,
And prompts a Stranger warmly to admire;
    One, who would glow to greet thee as his friend,
    And oft thy skilful pilotage require
    To shape Life's voyage smoothly to its end.
But this is Fancy's visionary joy: -- 
    My world-bound bark must course and hardy way,
    Mid rocks and shoals that threaten or annoy,
Near coasts, where error gleams her faithless ray,
    And beacons rarely blaze so bright as Thee,
    To guide over folly's shelves, and passion's troublous sea.
