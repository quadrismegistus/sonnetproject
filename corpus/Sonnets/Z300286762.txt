My friend! my father! here thy heavenly
mien,
    Here the last smile thy parting spirit hung
    On thy cold lips, as passing forth serene
    It sought the fount of love from whence it sprung,
Sorrowing I trace, and think how I have seen
    Thy meek eye beam sublime, while rapt thy tongue
    Told of Heaven's mercy, as each note had been
    To win the wanderer home, divinely strung!
The loved, the honoured, kind, parental air,
    Impress'd upon the cold and senseless stone,
    My streaming eye, and bursting heart declare,
As when in youth's wild joyous day, long flown,
    With smiles benignant, such as father's wear,
