Sometimes I wish that I his pillow were,
    So might I steal a kiss, and yet not seen,
    So might I gaze upon his sleeping eine,
Although I did it with a panting fear:
But when I well consider how vain my wish is,
    Ah foolish Bees (think I) that do not luck,
    His lips for honey; but poor flowers do pluck
Which have no sweet in them: when his sole kisses,
Are able to revive a dying soul.
    Kisse him, but sting him not, for if you do,
    His angry voice your flying will pursue:
But when they hear his tongue, what can control,
    Their back-return? for then they plain may see,
    How honey-combs from his lips dropping be.
