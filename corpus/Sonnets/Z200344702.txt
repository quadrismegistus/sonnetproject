Equally skilful or the Lyric string
    To touch, and laugh in many a jocund lay,
    Or against vice to rise with bold assay,
And Satire's burning brand with art to fling;

Roderick, why sleeps the Muse, while jolly spring
    In frolic dance leads-up the blooming May,
    And the sweet Nightingales on every spray
Take the ear prisoner with their carolling?

Or, if thy verse a higher theme demand,
    Mark the Mock-patriot, decked in proud array
        Of borrowed virtues, which his soul never knew,
Scattering fell poison through the cheated land;
    And, while to private power he paves his way,
        Dazzling with public good the blinded crew.
