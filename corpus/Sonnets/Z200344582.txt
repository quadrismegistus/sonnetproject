That I did love and once was loved of thee,
    Witness the favours that I have received:
That golden ring, pledge of thy constancy:
    That bracelet, that my liberty bereaved:
Those gloves, that once adorned thy lily hands:
    That handkerchief, whose maze enthralled me so:
Those thousand gifts, that Like a thousand bans
    Bound both my heart and soul to weal and woe.
All which I wear, and wearing them sighs forth
    You instancies of her true loyalty:
I do not keep you for your sovereign worth,
    But for her sake that sent you unto me:
Tis she, not you, that does compel my eyes,
My life's sole light, my hearts sole paradise.
