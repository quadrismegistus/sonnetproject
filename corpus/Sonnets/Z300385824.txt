Hence lose alluring looks, no more of Love,
no more thy seeming virtues shall deceive me.
Come, come my dearest, speak not thus to prove
How well I love; thou thinkest it does not grieve me.

Hence lose alluring looks, no more of Love,
no more thy seeming virtues shall deceive me.

Come, come my dearest, speak not thus to prove
How well I love; thou thinkest it does not grieve me.

Thy beauty was a bait to draw mine eye.
And with thy blink my heart was set on fire.
I thought to find a suiting soul in thee.
Thy love's the limit that bounds my desire.

Thy beauty was a bait to draw mine eye.

And with thy blink my heart was set on fire.
