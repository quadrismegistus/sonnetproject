They know not least, who have most needs, of rest,
    That last, kind refuge from overwhelming woes;
    Thee I invoke then, Sleep, thou friend of those
By ill on ill, and wrong on wrong oppressed,
The happiness that sometime I possessed,
    Though now bereft me by the craft of foes,
    Return in pitying visions of repose,
And bid me for a time again be blessed;
The while thou makest their waking conscience see
    Crimes that the noise and glare of day can hide;
Yes, when that Judge impartial gives thee
    O'er his eternal balance to preside,
    Repel that' o'erweenings of injurious pride,
And what thou takest from them restore to me.
