Beloved friends, I seek you once again;
Admit me to your sacred presence: here
I feel myself once more. My brain grows clear;
These walls expand, a temple's size attain.
The "Open-sesame," which can constrain
Its lofty gates with music Like the sphere
To give admission, I have learned. My ear
Catches a hum and murmur Like the main.
"The peaceful lords of spiritual fame" -- 
The only title Time will recognise -- 
Are there; and starlike shines each glorious name,
Looking eternity from steadfast eyes.
Wings have they, and their tongues are as a flame,
Like stubble to burn up the world's poor lies.
