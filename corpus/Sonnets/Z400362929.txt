Pack your heavy suitcase
when it is time to travel.
No use making the trip
just to spin the wheels.

Load that box you always
intended to deliver
crowd in all the knickknacks
nobody ever uses.

This train carries freight.
It's on time if it gets there.
Crossroads don't count, or Bells'.
There's a map and a dot and and engine.

It's cargo we want -- cargo:
just words won't get you there.
