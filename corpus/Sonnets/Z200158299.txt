[ON THE BUST OF A BACCHANTS, BY ALEXANDER GALT, OF VIRGINIA.]
Thou Image of sweet passion crowned with hope,
    Thou glorious Personation of flushed youth,
    Lost in the fresh dawn of a mystic truth,
    Whose hidden motion did exceed the scope
Of maiden wisdom -- thy bewildering face
    Thrilling beyond the marble -- thy glad port
    Of eager exaltation, where the sport
    Of childish nature, chastened by the grace
Of thy maturer spirit's subtlest sense,
    Breaks into starry sparkles of still bliss -- 
    These hold me spelled, and breathless, and dispense
Faint languors round me, and a radiant air
    Like some serenest morning's, touched to rare
