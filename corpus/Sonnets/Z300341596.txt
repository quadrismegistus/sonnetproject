Thy voice is surely nature's; for thy mind
Unhackney'd in the sordid paths of men,
Must from it's genuine feelings prompt thy pen,
Which with the warmth of youth imparting praise
Haply beyond what stricter justice might,
Yet from no selfish motive traced the lays
Which, (nor would I conceal it) charm my sighed,
And sweetest flattery bring, though undesigned.
Yes, Offspring of my Friend! these strains of thine
Unforced, and unaffected, strike my heart
With truer pleasure, than where dazzling shine
More glaring tints, the colourings of art.
These notes receive, due to taste pure and free,
To the sincere, the virtuous -- due to thee.
