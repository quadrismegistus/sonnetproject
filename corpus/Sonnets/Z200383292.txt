Clip not sweet love the wings of my desire,
    Although it soar aloft and mount too High:
But rather bear with me though I aspire:
    For I have wings to bear me to the sky.
What though I mount, there is no Sun but thee?
    And sith no other Sun, why should I fear?
Thou wilt not burn me though thou terrify:
    And though thy brightness do so great appear,
Dear, I seek not to batter down thy glory,
    Nor do I envy that thy hope increases:
Oh never think thy fame does make me sorry,
    For thou must live by fame when beauty ceases.
Besides, since from one root we both did spring,
Why should not I thy fame and beauty sing?
