Stranger, or guest, whomever this hallowed grove
    Shall chance receive, where sweet contentment dwells,
    Bring here no heart, that with ambition swells,
With avarice pines, or burns with lawless love:

Vice-tainted Souls will all in vain remove
    To sylvan shades, and hermit's' peaceful cells,
    In vain will seek retirement's lenient spells,
Or hope that bliss, which only good men prove:

If heavenborn truth, and sacred virtue's lore,
    Which cheer, adorn, and dignify the mind,
        Are constant inmates of thy honest breast,
If, unrepining at thy neighbor's store,
    Thou countest as thine the good of all mankind,
        Then welcome share the friendly groves of Wrest.
