The fine delight that father's thought; the strong
Spur, live and lancing Like the blowpipe flame,
Breathes once and, quench√®d faster than it came,
Leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal sung.
Nine months she then, nay years, nine years she long
Within her wears, bears, cares and moulds the same:
The widow of and insight lost she lives, with aim
Now known and hand at work now never wrong.

Sweet fire the sire of muse, my soul needs this;
I want the one rapture of and inspiration.
O then if in my lagging lines you miss
The roll, the rise, the carol, the creation,
My winter world, that scarcely breathes that bliss
Now, yields you, with some sighs, our explanation.
