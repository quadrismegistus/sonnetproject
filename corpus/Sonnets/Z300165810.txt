Amid this maple-avenue, on the brow
Of this cool hill, while summer suns were bold,
No gaudier colouring could I then behold
Than the deep green of many a breezy bough;
But up the foliage vista gazing now,
Where Autumn's halcyon brilliancies unfold
And opulent scarlet blends with dazzling gold,
I feel my wandering fancy dream of how,
In some old haughty city, centuries since,
Before the coming of some conqueror-prince
Back from famed fights with all his war-worn bans,
While jubilant Bells' in tower and steeple swung,
Down over sculptured balconies were hung
Great gorgeous tapestries out of Eastern lands!
