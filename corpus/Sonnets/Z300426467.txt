No, thou resplendent Sun! thy orient ray
    Shall not in silence to its height ascend;
    Thou comest, thus robbed in lustre, to attend
On social Bagnal [Footnote: 1Kb] this auspicious day,
When Youth, Wealth, Innocence, and Beauty gay
    Prepare to crown the virtues of my friend.
    Patron of Light and Verse! thyself shall lend
A beam of inspiration to my lay,
    Which, while it sings the merits of his mind
Where true Benevolence still active glows,
    And native sense with sterling Science joined,
And Honour firm alike to words and vows,
    Proclaims, that in her choice His Bride shall find
Through life, the Friend, the Lover, and the Spouse.
