No golden dome shines over Damien's sleep;
    A leper's grave upon a leprous strand
    Where hope is dead, and hand must shrink from hand
Where cataracts wail towards a moaning deep,
And frowning purple cliffs in mercy keep
    All wholesome life at distance, hath God planned
    For him who led his saintly hero band,
And died a shepherd of Christ's exiled sheep.

O'er Damien's dust the broad skies bend for dome,
    Stars burn for golden letters, and the sea
        Shall roll perpetual anthem round his rest;
For Damien made the charnelhouse life's home,
    Matched love with death: and Damien's name shall be
        A glorious benediction world-possessed.
