I sometime wonder if the Mighty God
Cares aught about the little deeds of men;
And if their day and time can reach His ken
Or raise their breath beyond the hungry sod.
Does He who lightly holds that' eternal rod,
Now taut, now lose, the threads of Why and When,
Give passing heed -- or be they one or ten -- 
To onetime flesh but now the windblown clod?

If men can die who never yet knew life,
And, smiling, hold it is no strange affair;
Or live when death were welcome boon of strife,
Torn, broken sheaves the ghostly reapers spare;
The saints must grieve for earthly sorrows rife,
And God must heed, yea surely, God must care.
