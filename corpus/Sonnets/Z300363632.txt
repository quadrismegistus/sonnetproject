Someone identical with Dante
sits beside a stone. Enough
is enough is enough of.
It's odd that your hand feels warm
(snow carefully falling).
It's odd that the page was torn
just where the snow had begun.
There was never very much.
There is more (less) than there was.
Today it is 84, 74 and 12
and light and dark.
We are nowhere else.
His smile fell to one side.
Here and there it was very light and dark.
