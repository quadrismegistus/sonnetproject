Sleech, to the generous voice of friendship, true!
Nor, though declining in the vale of age,
Coldly-neglectful of the muses' page,
These traces read; which, not in classic lore
Unversed, in early youth I fondly drew;
Nor yet in riper manhood uninspired,
While I the daughter of thy friend admired,
And as I more have known, have valued more.
Yes, to thy partial soul I will avow,
That when soft-blushing in her bridal dress,
No truer pleasure in my bosom rose,
Than what with ardour I experience now.
So much can virtue charm, and mildness bless,
So, nursed by time, sincere affection grows.
