Askest thou, why I court the slighted lyre?
    In Hope's, through' life ''twill cheer my steady way,
    Drawn by no worldly pomp, nor cares astray,
    And give me passport to the heavenly choir.
The conscience, pure delight that I inspire,
    And for good deeds alone pour forth the lay,
    No aid, my friend, to led me calmly gay
    Thro' ignorance and envy will require.
I strike the strings: and strait my purged ear
    Hears not their praise or blame. For if my sung
    Should, as it breathes, illume the brow of care,
The sluggard rouse, or bear the faint along;
    Shall I for self alone have laboured here?
Oh, no! The plea shall gain my soul heavens' tuneful throng.
