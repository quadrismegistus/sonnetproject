Black beauty, which above that common light,
    Whose Power can no colours here renew,
    But those which darkness can again subdue,
Do'st still remain unvaried to the sighed.

And Like and object equal to the view,
    And neither changed with day, nor hid with night,
    When all these colours which the world call bright,
And which old Poetry does so pursue,

Are with the night so perished and gone,
    That of their being there remains no mark,
Thou still abidest so entirely one,
    That we may know thy blackness is a spark
Of light inaccessible, and alone
    Our darkness which can make us think it dark.
