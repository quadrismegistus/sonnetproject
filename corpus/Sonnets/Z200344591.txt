Ye subjects of her partial painted praise,
    Pen, paper, ink, you feeble instruments:
Unto a higher strain I now must raise
    Your mistress beauteous fair abiliments.
Thou author of our High Meonian verse,
    That checks the proud Castalians eloquence:
With humble spirit if I now rehearse
    Her several graces nature's excellence:
Smile on these rough-hewed lines, these ragged words
    That never stiled from the Castalian spring:
Nor that one true Apologie affords,
    Nor never learned with pleasant tune to sing:
So shall they live, and living still persever
To deify her sacred name for ever.
