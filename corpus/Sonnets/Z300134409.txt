'A parrot Edward Lear drew has just died.'
There was a young lady of Corstorphine
who adopted a psittacine orphan.
It shrieked and it cried: they threw far and wide
her ashes right over Corstorphine. Zoos
guard and pamper the abandoned squawkers,
tickle stories from the raunchy talkers,
shoulder a bold centenarian muse
over artists deaf as earth. 'Oho! Lear
sketched me, delirious old man, how he
shuffled about, his tabby on the sill,
a stew on the stove, a brush in his ear,
and sometime hummed, or he buzzed Like a be,
painting parrots and all bright brave things still!'
