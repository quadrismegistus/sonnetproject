If he who through this Coppice steers,
Should harm its native choristers,
Or younglings seize, or nests destroy;
May sylvan plagues his peace annoy.
Him may the sounding hornet scare
With dart and gilded coat of war;
Him may the fleet gnat slily sting
While dors against him dash their wing:
Across his path may paddocks sprawl,
Around his couch let earwigs crawl;
His wells may water-newts infest,
May screech-owls break his midnight rest,
And should he doze at morning grey,
Let his shrill herald be the jay!
