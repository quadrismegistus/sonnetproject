Ere elfish Night shall sift another day
Hope-broken 'neath her ebon scepter's keep,
Or the fainting soul's last flames all trembling creep
White-taper-like, and paler, pulse away,
Then shalt thou come, O Saint, in magic sway
Of midnight's purple organ-breath, and sweep
Brave echoes from the spooming coast to steep,
Blue heights where cone-wood calls near summits spray
Frost-fringes through thine octaves ... And from shades
Of moon-fled valleys, there shall rise a rift,
The supplication of all earth, mute serenades,
Whispering, "Cecilia, Saint, leave us thy gift."
And sleep shalt thou bestow, the final sung,
And Time shall set the morning stars adrift.
