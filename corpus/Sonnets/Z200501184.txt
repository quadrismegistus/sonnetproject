By sweet Therapia waited for awhile
    Our fleet, fair ca√Øque, -- 'it the evening's hour -- 
    The read Sun sought his splendid western bower,
Which no dark, angry clouds might dare defile,
And gave the world one gorgeous, parting smile
    To live on -- till once more he comes in power! -- 
    The mountains to the sky, that soaring tower,
Each gradually became a sable pile;
    There spread a softness on the dreamy air,
A stillness on the waters -- such imparts,
    Even to the heart, overworn with heavy care,
Dear peace; aye, even to Grief's crushed Heart of hearts,
    Who, who would not a smile of gladness wear
On such sweet eve, whence Love's own Soul-light darts?
