O sprung from worthies, who with counsels wise
    Adorn'd and strengthened great Elisa's throne,
Who yet with virtuous pride, mayest well despise
    To borrow praise from merits not thy own.

Oft as I view the monumental stone
    Where our loved H&wblank;'s cold ashes rest,
Musing on joys with him long passed and gone,
    A pleasing sad remembrance fills my breast. -- 

Did the sharp pang we feel for friends deceased
    Unbated last, we must with anguish die;
But nature bids its rigour should be eased
    By lenient time, and strong necessity:
These calm the passion, and subdue the mind
To bear appointed lot of human kind.
