Wood, who when first my muse essayed her flight,
And on chaste plume, through the polluted air
Winnow'd her way; in calumny's despite,
And the vile manners of a carping age
Wertenberg not afraid thy judgement to declare,
And praise in classic notes, my tuneful page!
This suited well the freedom of thy soul,
Which, when convinced, from truth's attractive shrine
No force can turn; despising base control,
Soaring above a sphere, unjustly thine.
View still, unprejudiced, the tender lay!
Which, hid from the wild scenes of noise and folly,
I as a tribute, only mean to pay
To love, to purged taste, and friendship holy.
