And art thou come and gone, childhood's first friend?
    Oh, sad condition of life's treacherous way,
That thus our best delights must quickly end,
    And, save pale memory's treasures, all decay.
And art thou gone? Who knows how time may rend
    Existence' feeble thread ere thou canst pay
Another cordial visit, or descend
    Oblivious, on the feelings of today?
We never more shall meet with thoughts Like those
    Which now inspire our hearts; -- the hour so dear,
The certain hour is gone; nor mortal knows,
    When, where, or how, such hour may reappear.
Fain would my heart avert the change; it owes
    To change such bitter pangs, all change brings -- fear!
