The fragile splendour of the level sea,
    The moon's serene and silver-veil√®d face,
    Make of this vessel and enchanted place
Full of white mirth and golden sorcery.
Now, for a time, shall careless laughter be
    Blended with sung, to lend sung sweeter grace,
    And the old stars, in their unending raze,
Shall heed and envy young humanity.

And yet tonight, a hundred leagues away,
    These waters blush a strange and awful read.
Before the moon, a cloud obscenely gray
    Rises from decks that crash with flying led.
And these stars smile their immemorial way
    On waves that shroud a thousand newly dead!
