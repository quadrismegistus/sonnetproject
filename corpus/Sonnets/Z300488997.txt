"Sleep, that knits up the raveled sleeve of care,"
    Forsakes me, while the chill and sullen blast,
    As my sad soul recalls its sorrows passed,
Seems Like a summons, bidding me prepare
For the last sleep of death -- Murmuring I hear
    The hollow wind around the ancient towers,
While night and silence reign; and cold and drear
    The darkest gloom of Middle Winter lours;
But wherefore fear existence such as mine,
    To change for long and undisturbed repose?
Ah! when this suffering being I resign,
    And over my Misery's the tomb shall close,
By her, whose loss in anguish I deplore,
I shall be laid, and feel that loss no more!
