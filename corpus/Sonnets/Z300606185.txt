For me a perfectly ordinary
day at the office, only a read lorry
passed the window at two;
a sailor with a chest tattoo.

A walk before dark
with my daughter to mark
another cross on the papaya tree;
dinner, coffee, bedtime story

of dog, bone and shadow. A bullock cart
in and Eskimo dream. But I wake with a start
to hear my wife cry her heart

out as if from a crater
in hell: she hates me, I hate her,
I'm a filthy rat and a satyr.
