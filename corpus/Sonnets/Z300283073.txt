We stayed at Lyons three days, only three,
    In Esther's world of wonder and renown,
She, glorious star, each night immortally
    Playing her Manons to the listening town.
I glorious too, but in Love's firmament,
    Watching her face by which alone I moved,
A shadow near her raptured and intent,
    And seeking still the signs that I was loved.
Thrice happy days! Thrice blessed tragedy!
    Her Des Grieux was I, her lover lorn
Bound to her Fortune's, blessed to live or die,
    And faithful ever though to faith forsworn,
Waiting behind the scenes in that stage-land
To greet her exits and to squeeze her hand.
