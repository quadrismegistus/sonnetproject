That learned Gr√¶cian (who did so excel
In Knowledge passing Sense, that he is named
Of all the after-Worlds Divine) does tell,
That at the Time when first our Souls are framed,
Ere in these Mansions blind they come to dwell,
They live bright Rayes of that Eternal Light,
And others see, know, love, in Heavens great Hight,
Not toylde with aught to Reason does rebel;
Most true it is, for straight at the first Sight
My Minde me told, that in some other Place
It elsewhere saw the Idea of that Face,
And loved a Love of heavenly pure Delight.
    No Wonder now I feel so fair a Flame,
    Sith I Her loved ere on this Earth she came.
