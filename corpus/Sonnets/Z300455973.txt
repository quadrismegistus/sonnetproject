In this calm shade, while summer's halcyon sky
    Tints the broad flood with one cerulean hue,
    Save where a casual cloud, soft flitting by,
    Streaks the bright azure with a darker blue.
In this calm shade, while many and insect-quire,
    Blown over the thymy turf on vagrant wing,
    Float gaily round, or sportively retire,
    And to the passing gale their descant fling.
Here, let me mark with what impassioned force
    The Bard of Wotton breathes his love-lorn tale,
    Or pours the plaintive sweetness of his verse
As Petrarch poured it down Valclusa's vale:
    For in his graceful numbers are combined
    'Softness of heart with energy of mind.'
