Since I must now eradicate the Flame,
    Which, seeing you, Love in my Bosom placed,
    And the Desires which thus long could last,
Kindled so well, and nourished in the same.

Since Time, that first saw their Original,
    Must triumph in their end, and Victor be,
    Let's have a brave Design, and to be free,
Cut off at once the Briar-rose, and all.

Let us put out the Fire Love has begotten,
Break the tough Cord tied with so fast a knot,
    And voluntary take a brave adieu.

So shall we nobly conquer Love and Fate,
And at the Liberty of choice do that,
    Which time its self, at last, would make us do.
