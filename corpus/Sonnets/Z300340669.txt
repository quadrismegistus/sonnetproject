Oft did I hear, our Eyes the passage were
    By which Love entered to avail our hearts;
Therefore I guarded them, and void of fear
    Neglected the defence of other parts.
Love knowing this, the usual way forsook,
    And seeking, found a byway by mine Eare:
At which he entering, my Hart prisoner took,
    And unto thee sweet Philomel did bear.
Yet let my heart thy heart to pity move,
    Whose pain is great, although small fault appear:
First it lies bound in fettering-chains of Love,
    Then each day it is racked with hope and fear.
And with Love's flame 'this evermore consumed,
Only because to love thee it presumed.
