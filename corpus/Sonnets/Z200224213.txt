Bloody history. Who knows what you mean.
The mind that carries is also carried,
there is a galaxy that moves these things around.

Go ahead and seem. Forgive the meaning.
Everything sweeping towards Sagittarius,
wise man with a beast's body, arrow in his hand.

We used to think we spoke the consonants
that shaped some everlasting vowel,
howl or groan or moan or sighs of time

but I don't know. Things come and go
without arriving or departing.
We are archers curiously void of arrows,

anxious in a targetless universe. We twang the bow
only for the music's sake, I guess.
