O hair, fair hair, some of the golden threads
Of vich love veues the nets that passion breeds,
Vher me Like silly bird he does retain,
And only death can make me free again;
Ah I you love, embrasse, kiss, and adore,
For that you shadow did that face before;
That face so full of beauty, grace, and love,
That it hath jealous made Heavens quire above:
To you I'l tell my secret thochts and grief
Since she, deer she, can grant me no relief.
Vhile me from her, foul traitor, absence binds,
Vitnesse, sweet hair, with me, how love me blinds;
For vhen I should seek vhat his force restrains,
I foolish bear about his nets and chains.
