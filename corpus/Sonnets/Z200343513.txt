She told the story, and the whole world wept
    At wrongs and cruelties it had not known
    But for this fearless woman's voice alone.
    She spoke to consciences that long had slept:
Her message, Freedom's clear reveille, swept
    From heedless hovel to complacent throne.
    Command and prophecy were in the tone
    And from its sheath the sword of justice leapt.
Around two peoples swelled a fiery wave,
    But both came forth transfigured from the flame.
Blessed be the hand that dared be strong to save,
    And blessed be she who in our weakness came -- 
    Prophet and priestess! At one stroke she gave
    A raze to freedom and herself to fame.
