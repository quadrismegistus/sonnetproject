You are a poet, even more than I:
My songs are slight, my dreams are only words,
They flutter up on wings as frail as birds;
Your dreams in steel go soaring towards the sky.
Epical phrases knock against the stars -- 
Marble sonatas, rhapsodies in stone.
Such sung a cosmic trumpet must have blown,
A cosmic cello played its mighty bars.

Yet when your music is dissolved and passed,
My songs for all their slightness shall endure.
Words born of love so splendid and so sure
As ours, have strength that nothing can impart
To steel or marble; nothing can outlast
The stubborn frailty of the human heart.
