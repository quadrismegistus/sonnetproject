If any man would know the very cause
    Which makes me to forget my speech in rhyme,
    All the sweet songs I sang in other time, -- 
I'll tell it in a sonnet's simple clause.
I hourly have beheld how good withdraws
    To nothing, and how evil mounts the while:
    Until my heart is gnawed as with a file,
Nor aught of this world's worth is what it was.
At last there is no other remedy
    But to behold the universal end;
        And so upon this hope my thoughts are urged:
To whom, since truth is sunk and dead at sea,
    There has no other part or prayer remained,
        Except of seeing the world's self submerged.
