That sung again! -- its sounds my bosom thrill,
    Breathe of passed years, to all their joys allied;
    And, as the notes through' my soothed spirits glide,
    Dear recollection's choicest sweets distil,
Soft as the morn's calm Due on yonder hill,
    When slants the sun upon its grassy side,
    Tinging the brooks that many a mead divide
    With lines of gilded light; and blue, and still,
The distant lake stands gleaming in the vale.
    Sing, yet once more, that well-remembered strain,
    Which oft made vocal every passing gale
In days long fled, in Pleasure's golden reign,
    The youth of changed Honora! -- now it wears
    Her air -- her smile -- spells of the vanished years!
