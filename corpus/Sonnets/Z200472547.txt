Upon his fir-bough mattress dying lay
    The youngest herdsman of the Wengern folk,
    And very tenderly the greybeards spoke
Of home and friends in valleys far away.
He clasped his hands together, seemed to prey,
    Then slept, but sudden from his dream awoke
    Crying, 'The young bull from the pasture broke,
But I must bring him back ere close of day.'

And he went forth in spirit to the wild,
    His eyes are closed, his body lies stark still,
        And round his bed gaze wistfully the kine.
Father of all, Thou wilt receive this child
    Who, to the last, earth's duty would fulfil,
        For work is prayer, the labourer's wage is Thine.
