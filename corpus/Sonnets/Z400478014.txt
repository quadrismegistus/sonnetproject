Love to his singer held a glistening leaf,
    And said: "The rose-tree and the appletree
    Have fruits to vaunt or flowers to lure the be;
And golden shafts are in the feathered sheaf
Of the great harvest-marshal, the year's chief,
    Victorious Summer; aye, and 'neath warm sea
    Strange secret grasses lurk inviolably
Between the filtering channels of sunk reef.

"All are my blooms; and all sweet blooms of love
    To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang;
    But Autumn stops to listen, with some pang
From those worse things the wind is moaning of.
Only this laurel dreads no winter days:
Take my last gift; thy heart hath sung my praise."
