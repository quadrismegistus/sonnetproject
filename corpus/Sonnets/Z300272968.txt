Ah no; nor I my self: though my pure love
    (Sweet Ganymede to thee hath still been pure,
    And even till my last gasp shall aye endure,
Could ever thy obdurate beauty move:
Then cease o Goddess son (for sure thou art,
    A Goddess son that canst resist desire)
    Cease thy hard heart, and entertain loves fire,
Within thy sacred breast: by Natures art.
And as I love thee more then any Creature,
    (Love thee, because thy beauty is divine;
    Love thee, because my self, my soul is thine;
Wholie devoted to thy lovely feature)
    Even so of all the vowels, I and V,
    Are dearest unto me, as does ensue.
