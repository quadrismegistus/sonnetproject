Look when dame Tellus clad in Floras pride,
    Her summer veil with fair embroidery,
And fragrant herbs sweet blossomed having died.
    And spread abroad her spangled tapestry:
Then shalt thou see a thousand of her flowers
    (For their fair hew and life delighting savours)
Gathered to deck and beautify the bowers
    Of Ladies fair, graced with their lovers favours.
But when rough winter nips them with his rage,
    They are disdained and not at all respected:
Then love (Emaricdulf) in thy young age,
    Lest being old, Like flowers thou be rejected:
Nature made nothing that does ever flourish,
And even as beauty fades, so love does perish.
