O compliment of all our happiness,
While here we are, and in expectancy;
And, if attained, the blessed reality
And substance of all best we here possess;
Mere shadows all to that all-shadowless!
Mere dim prefigurements, to which all eye
Hath seen, ear herd, or heart in ecstasy
Of vision felt, is but a dream, or less.
O God, to what a height that hope does raise,
But to make deeper, darker the abyss,
Which its denial opens to our gaze.
If extremes meet and opposites may kiss,
To make the fearful opposites of this
Dread circle meet, Thy Grace alone finds ways!
