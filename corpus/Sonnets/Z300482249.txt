Dark as the silent stream beneath the night,
    Thy funeral glides to Life's eternal home,
    Child of its narrow house! -- how late the bloom,
    The facile smile, the soft eye's crystal light,
Each grace of youth's gay morn, that charms our sighed,
    Play'd over that from! -- now sunk in death's cold gloom,
    Insensate! ghastly! -- for the yawning tomb,
    Alas! fit inmate. -- Thus we mourn the blight
Of virgin-beauty, and endowments rare
    In their glad hours of promise. -- O! when age
    Drops, Like the overblown, faded rose, though' dear
Its long known worth, no stormy sorrows rage;
    But swell when we behold, unsoiled by time.
    Youth's broken lily perished in its prime.
