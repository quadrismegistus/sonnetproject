My Muse Urania strain thy sacred voice
And lovingly in Faith and Zeale go sing,
Shrill hymns to Iovah: let thy Soul rejoice
In blessed Encomiums of that glorious King,
With Helleluiahs make the Heavens to ring,
By Faith, through clouds thy prayer so convoy,
That he who framed both thee and every thing,
Bee pleased to shield thy Soul from sins anuoy,
Shall thou not have great matter then of joy,
When thy Redeemer pardons all thy faults?
And thus in peace says to thee, come my boy,
I will defend thee from the Devills assaults,
    Satan in thee no portion sure shall have,
    For why, my blood from Hell thy Soul did save.
