Bright Queen of night's lone kingdom, high in air
    Thy silvery orb how have I loved to see,
    Nor dreamed that mighty potency could be
In aught so mild, so peaceful, and so fair,
Yet, harmless, as thou gildest my Mira's hair,
    Or biddest thy cold beams kiss her beauteous cheek,
    And lookest Like her as radiantly meek!
Too well with thine her empire may compare;
For as thy influence the wild waters find
    And still submissive on thy state attend,
While, to compel their pride, the angry wind,
    The nave of heaven, itself in vain might rend,
So have her magic charms subdued a mind
    That tyrant violence could never bend!
