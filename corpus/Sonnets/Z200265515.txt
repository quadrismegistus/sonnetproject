See, while thou weepest, fair Chloe, see
The World in sympathy with thee.
The cheerful Birds no longer sing;
Each drops his head, & hangs his wing:
The clouds have bent their bosom lower;
And shed their sorrows in a shower:
The Brooks beyond their limits flow:
And louder murmurs speak their woe:
The Nymphs & Swains adopt thy cares:
They heave thy sighs, & weep thy tears:
Fantastick Nymph! that Grief should move
Thy heart obdurate against Love.
Strange tears! whose power can soften all,
But that dear Breast on which they fall.
