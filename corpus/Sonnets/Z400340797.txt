Ascention.
Salute the last and everlasting day,
Joy at the uprising of this Sun, and Son,
Yee whose just tears, or tribulation
Have purely washed, or burned your drossy clay;
Behold the Highest, parting hence away,
Lightens the dark clouds, which he treads upon,
Nor does he by ascending, show alone,
But first he, and he first enters the way,
O strong Ramme, which hast battered heaven for me,
Mild lamb which with thy blood, hast marked the path;
Bright torch, which shinest, that I the way may see,
Oh, with thy own blood quench thy own just wrath,
And if thy holy Spirit, my Muse did raise,
