Fair is my Yoke, though grievous be my Paines,
Sweet are my Wounds, although they deeply smart,
My Bit is Gold, though shortened be the Raines,
My Bondage brave, though I may not depart:
Although I burn, the Fire which does impart
Those Flames, so sweet reviving Force contains,
That (Like Arabias Bird) my wasted Heart
Made quick by Death, more lively still remains.
I joy, though oft my waking Eyes spend Tears,
I never want Delight, even when I groan,
Best companied when most I am alone,
A Heaven of Hope's I have amid Hells of Feares:
    Thus every Way Contentment strange I find,
    But most in Her rare Beauty, my rare Minde.
