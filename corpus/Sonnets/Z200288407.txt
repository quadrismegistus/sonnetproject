ONCE more, my Hawkins, I attempt to raise
    My feeble voice to urge the tuneful sung
    Of that sweet Muse, which to her Country's wrong
Or sleeps, or only wakes to Latian lays.

Great is the Merit, well-deserved the praise
    Of that last Work, where Reasoning just and strong
    In charming verse thy name shall bear along
To learned foreigners, and future days:

Yet do not thou thy native language scorn,
    In which great Shakespear, Spenser, Milton sang
        Such strains as may with Greek, or Roman vie:
This cultivate, raise, polish, and adorn;
    So each fair Maid shall on thy numbers hang,
        And every Briton bless thy melody.
