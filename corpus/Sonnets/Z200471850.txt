How many setting suns, in vain, shall make
Their golden summons at this harbour door!
 [Footnote 1: 1Kb]
How many seas shall idly beat the shore,
And urge admittance to yond mighty lake!
Still must the crane unwind, the trolly take,
Spade above spade must scallop out the floor;
Till, through the rift, shall swim the floating store
To that stone hull no ocean storms can shake!
Then, where the wagtail shows his dainty ways,
The mightiest ocean keel unharmed shall graze!
Screw-blades will churn where pick and spade prevail:
And cranes that laid the stone will hoist the bale!
Men shall rejoice, though desert Avon mourn
