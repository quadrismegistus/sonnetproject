Your hair is rufulous as the puffed rust
Blebbing a musket stock, vermicular
As the crimped locks stringing from the coif are
In Niccol√≤ Fiorentino's bust
Of D'Este. Your odour carries no disgust
So long as rose-verbena haunts your silk cymar
And glaives of heat are not allowed to scar
Your skin that's thin as fish-scales. Yet unbussed
Your mouth poutest Like a lethal read mushroom
Blistering spongy tree trunks in a wood
Anfractuous with Boles and stumps. Assume
I am a wooden horse hauled or stood
To please some small Ulysses in the blood,
Is it not clever, this, your toppling doom?
