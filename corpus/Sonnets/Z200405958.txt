In that, this Book does deign Sejanus name,
Him unto more, than CÃ¦sars love, it brings:
    For, where he could not with ambition's wings,
    One quill does heave him to the height of Fame.
Yee great-ones though (whose ends may be the same)
    Know, that, how ever we do flatter Kings,
    Their favours (Like themselves) are fading things,
    With no less envy had, than lost with shame.
Nor make your selves less honest than you are,
    To make our Author wiser than he is:
    Ne of such crimes accuse him, which I dare
By all his Muses swear, be none of his.
    The men are not, some faults may be these times:
    He acts those men, and they did act these crimes.
