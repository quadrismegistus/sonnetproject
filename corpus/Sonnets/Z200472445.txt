Land of undying Winter, endless Spring,
         -- For twice behind the scythe your valleys shine;
        Land of the broad-leaved chestnut and the pine,
Where all the flowers their gayest garlands fling
Before the feet of Summer; where Bells' ring
        An echo to the music of the kine;
        Land doubly flowing with milk and mellow wine,
 -- Milk of pure kindness, wine of welcoming -- 
To you I come, worn out with petty care,
    Come, for the cuckoo called me; let blue floods
        And your white-blossoming valleys close me round,
And give me leave with simple faith to share
    The solace of your mountain solitudes,
        And walk with Freedom on her native ground.
