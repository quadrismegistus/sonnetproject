Hawkins, whose lips the Muses have imbued
    With all the sweetness of that' Aonian spring;
    Whom emuling I deftly learned to sing,
And smoother tune my numbers rough and rude;

Truce with the jangling Law's eternal feud,
    It's subtle quirks, and captious caviling;
    Unlike the Muse's gentle whispering,
Which leads the Heaven-taught Soul to Fit and Good:

Thee more beseems in Eloquence' fair field,
    The Senate, war with Faction's chiefs to wage,
    Bare the Mock-Patriot's ill dissembled crime,
Nor let fair Truth to feigned seeming yield;
    With thy sweet Lyre to catch the listening Age,
    And sing thy Trimnell's charms in deathless rhyme.
