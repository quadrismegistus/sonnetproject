Grief how into useless age away
ebbed youth and I was unhappy all those years
I also do not feel, for now new fears
possess me and I steel myself today
today's pain to endure, so I can die
without a reckoning and weep no tears
for promises deceived. Maybe my peers
or my disciples will this tribute pay.

Oh, when He bound my arms behind my back
and threw me in the sea, I herd Him call
"Swim! swim!" and so I have swum to this hour
breathless in the cold water rough and black
where many have already drowned and all
shall drown in the swells that sink and tower.
