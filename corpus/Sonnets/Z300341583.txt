Simcoe, however in weak illiberal days
Merit may toil in vain, and valour bleed,
Denied by prejudiee their well-earned meed;
Yet, mindful of her office high of yore,
The Muse her virid garland shall prepare
And gird the intwisted foliage round their hair:
Tune with sincerest voice her notes of praise,
Bid glory open her refulgent store,
While truth and virtue sanctify her lays,
Read, and approved till time shall be no more.
Thy gallant acts, and each intrepid deed
Tis hers to adorn. Nor thou, each softer air
Refuse; the strains which she to love could yield,
While thou were harrassed in the strifeful field.
