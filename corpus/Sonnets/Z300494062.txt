Thou lingerest, Spring! still wintery is the scene,
The fields their dead and sapless russet wear;
Scarce does the glossy celandine appear
Starring the sunny bank, or early green
The elder yet its circling tufts put forth.
The sparrow tenants still the eaves-built nest
Where we should see our martin's snowy breast
Oft darting out. The blasts from the bleak north
And from the keener east still frequent blow.
Sweet Spring, thou lingerest; and it should be so, .
Late let the fields and gardens blossom out!
Like man when most with smiles thy face is dressed,
'Tis to deceive, and he who knows you best,
When most you promise, ever most must doubt.
