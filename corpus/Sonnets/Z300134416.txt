The jungle of Gleneagles was a long
shadow on our right as we traveled down.
Boars rummaged through the ballroom's toppled crown
of chandeliers and mashed the juicy throng
of giant hogweed stalks. Wild tramps with sticks
glared, kept a rough life. South in Fife we saw
the rusty buckled bridges, the firth raw
with filth and flower-heads, dead fish, dark slicks.
We stood in what had once been Princes Street.
Hogweed roots thrust, throbbed underneath for miles.
The rubble of the shops became the food
of new cracks running mazes round our feet,
and west winds blue, passed shattered bricks and tiles,
millions of seeds through ruined Holyrood.
