Heir of thy Sires four Realms, and (which I more
    Esteeme) four virtues, that unto a fifth,
    No doubt will thee (oh slowly slowly) lift;
    Receive this Ryme of thine old Auncestore
Long Prince of Wales, and pardon me therefore.
    So may glad Victory be one day swift
    To crown thy sacred head (that art a grift
    Extracted hence) with holy Baize, before
(Vnuanquish'd or unhurt by sea or land)
    Upon thy brow the Wreath of England sit:
    And I with crowned head, but armed hand,
Ride by thy Lordly side, and after it
    Turn from thy Grandsires loves to sing thy wars,
    Exchanging Venus Mole for Marses skars.
