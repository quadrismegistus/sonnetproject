Langhorne, unknown to me (sequestered swain!)
    Save by the Muse's soul-enchanting lay,
To kindred spirits never sung in vain,
    Accept the tribute of this light essay;

Due for thy sweet songs that amused my day!
    Where Fancy held her visionary reign,
    Or Scotland's honours claimed the pastoral strain.
Or Music came over Handel tears to pay:

For all thy Irwan's flowery banks display,
    Thy Persian lover and his Indian fair;
All Theodosius' mournful lines convey,
    Where Pride and Av'rice part a matchless pair;
Receive just praise and wreaths that never decay,
    By Fame and Virtue twined for thee to wear.
