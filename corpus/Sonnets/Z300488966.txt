The shivering native, who by Tenglio's side
    Beholds with found regret the parting light
Sink far away, beneath the darkening tide,
    And leave him to long months of dreary night,
Yet knows, that springing from the eastern wave
    The Sun's glad beams shall re-illume his way,
And from the snows secured -- within his cave
    He waits in patient hope -- returning day.
Not so the sufferer feels, who, over the waste
    Of joyless life, is destined to deplore
Fond love forgotten, tender friendship passed,
    Which, once extinguished, can revive no more!
O'er the blank void he looks with hopeless pain;
For him those beams of heaven shall never shine again.
