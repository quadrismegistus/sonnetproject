Rapt Contemplation, bring thy waking dreams
    To this umbrageous vale at noontide hour,
    While ull of thee seems every bending flower,
    Whose petals tremble over the shadowed streams
Give thou Honora's image, when her beams,
    Youth, beauty, kindness, shone; -- what time she wore
    That smile, of gentle, yet resistless power
    To sooth each painful passion's wild extremes.
Here shall no empty, vain intruder chase,
    With idle converse, thy enchantment warm,
    That brings, in all its interest, all its grace,
The dear, persuasive, visionary from.
    Can real life a rival blessing boast,
    When thou canst thus restore Honora early lost?
