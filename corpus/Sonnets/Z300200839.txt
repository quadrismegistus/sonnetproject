Farewell! you visions of my wayward brain,
Farewell! I send you from this lonely bower;
But I shall never forget your soothing power,
Although perhaps we never meet again;
Yet I have not communed with you in vain,
If but some portion of that hallowed fire,
Which roused the ancient barred to pour his strain,
Has warmed my lips and raised my spirit higher.
Ye go abroad upon a stormy sea,
But there are some, perchance, may not despise
Such trifles, though they were composed by me,
And they may view them with approving eyes
While I, as I have ever been, shall be,
Lone reader of the woods, the waters, and the skies.
