Taylor, whose merits I have known, and prize!
Who fostering qualities of noble kind,
Which from the nicest sense of honour rise,
With which the graces deck the chosen mind:
Hast cherished youthful learning's classic store,
(Too often from the soldier's precincts chased)
Imagination's ever-pleasing lore
Soothing each anxious thought, and liberal taste,
And virtuous love whose pure ideal train
Still shielded thee from folly light and vain!
Accept this page; and to thy Charlotte's ear
Reading the impassioned numbers, tell the maid
My Thespia no fictitious dress arrayed;
Their's sister souls, my verse, Like thine, sincere.
