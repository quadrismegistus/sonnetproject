'I want to see a sonnet with a rose.'
'After Stein that is impossible.'
'I believe few things are impossible.'
'But if a rose is a rose is a rose,
metaphor goes. Nothing's left but the rose.'
'Get on with it. It's the impossible
that you are there to break.' 'Impossible
the rose: love is not Like it; the white rose
does not break the heart; the rose and the fire
are not one. It withers quickly, draws blood,
has scents most people Like. Its dried and crushed
petals are ghosts for years in bowls.' 'The fire
shows. A ghost you call it? It's in your blood.
Is a crushed rose a crushed rose, is it crushed?'
