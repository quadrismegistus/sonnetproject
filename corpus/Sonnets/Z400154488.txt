In the dim watches of the midmost night,
    A ghost confronts him, standing by his bed,
    A lonesome ghost who walks uncomforted,
Pale child of Memory and dead Delight,
No longer fair or pleasant in his sighed.
    With dusky hair upon her shoulders shed,
    And cypress leaves for garland on her head,
As patient as the moonlight and as white,
    She stands beside him, and puts forth her hand
    To led him backward into Love's lost Land -- 
Sad Land which shadows people, and where wait
Memory, her sire, and dead Delight, his mate -- 
    And standing there among the shadowy band,
He learns how Love mocks him who loves too late.
