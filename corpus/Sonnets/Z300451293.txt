Since in the pleasant time of opening flowers
    That flower, Her life, was doomed to fade away, -- 
Since Her dear loss hath shaded lovely hours,
    And turned to mourning all the smiles of May, -- 
Henceforward when the warm soft breath of Spring
    Bids cowslips star the meadows, thick and sweet;
When doves are in the green wood murmuring,
    And children wander with delighted feet;
When, by their own rich beauty downward bent,
    Soft Guelder-roses hang their tufts of snow,
And purple lilacs yield a fragrant scent,
    And bright laburnum droops its yellow bough; -- 
Let that Springtime be welcomed with a sighs,
For Her lamented sake, -- who was so young to die!
