If ever again my spirit be allowed
Converse with nature in her chambers deep,
Where lone, and mantled with the rolling cloud,
She brood's over newborn waters, as they leap
In swordlike flashes down the heathery steep
From caves of mystery; -- if I rome once more
Where dark pines quiver to the torrent's roar,
And voiceful oaks respond! -- shall I not reap
A more ennobling joy, a loftier power,
Than ever was shed on life's more vernal hour,
From such communion? -- yes! I then shall know,
That not in vain have sorrow, love, and thought,
Their long still work of preparation wrought,
For that more perfect sense of God revealed below.
