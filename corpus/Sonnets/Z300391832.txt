"I dwell among mine own," -- Oh! happy thou!
    Not for the sunny clusters of the vine,
Not for the olives on the mountain's brow;
    Nor the flocks wandering by the flowery line
    Of streams, that make the green land where they shine
Laugh to the light of waters -- not for these,
Nor the soft shadow of ancestral trees,
    Whose kindly whisper floats over thee and thine -- 
Oh! not for these I call thee richly blessed,
But for the meekness of thy woman's breast,
        Where that sweet depth of still contentment lies;
    And for thy holy household love, which clings
    Unto all ancient and familiar things,
Weaving from each some link for home's dear charities.
