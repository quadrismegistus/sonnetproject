Doth of thy face the shame not cover thee,
O England! or must thy dull cheeks be made
To tingle by vicarious shame's sharp aid?
Shall Strangers' senses be more graced to see
And blush for thy shortcomings! or shall he
Who, moved by noble emulation, laid
His offering on that shrine, say or hear said -- 
"Thou grudgest little where he gave so free,
And he a stranger!" Pocket thy false pride;
The gift take, but put out at interest!
Thy Nelson's glory 'neath thy "bushel" hide!
Then, when his fame (shield to thy thankless breast),
And very shame, thy lagging action chide,
Stick up a "Guy," and at the cost protest!
