In sultry noon when youthful Milton lay, [Footnote: 1Kb]
    Supinely stretched beneath the poplar shade,
    Lured by his from, a fair Italian maid
    Steals from her loitering chariot, to survey
The slumbering charms, that all her soul betray.
    Then, as coy fears that' admiring gaze upbraid,
    Starts; -- and these lines, with hurried pen portrayed,
    Slides in his half-closed hand; -- and speeds away. -- 
"Ye eyes, you human stars! -- if, thus concealed
    "By sleep's soft veil, you agitate my heart,
    "Ah! what had been its conflict if revealed
"Your rays had shone!" -- Bright nymph, thy strains impart
    Hope's, that impel the graceful barred to rove,
    Seeking through' Tuscan vales his visionary love.
