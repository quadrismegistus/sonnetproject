When Chloris first with his hart-robbing-eie
Inchaunted had my silly senses all,
I little did respect loves cruelty,
I never thought his snares should me enthral:
But since his tresses have entangled me,
My pining flock did never hear me sing
Those jolly notes which erst did make them glee,
Nor do my kids about me leap and spring,
As they were wont, but when they hear me cry
They likewise cry and fill the air with bleating:
Then do my sheep upon the cold earth lie,
And feed no more, my griefs they are repeating.
    O Chloris if thou then sawest them and me
    I'am sure thou wouldst both pity them and me.
