From the dark deeps of this our endless woe,
To those dark deeps that stopped such manly breath,
    Like one in fear, who, halting, listeneth
If any call, our hearts flit to and from,
Your voices found not, but one voice I know -- 
    It is the solemn sovereign voice of Death:
    "There is a world beyond this world," it says,
"There is a deep to which thou canst but go."

Untimely lost! and only back to come
    With speechless mouth, calm faces, sightless eyes,
        Well have you ridden out Earth's wildest gale,
        Companions still with Christ aboard you sail,
    A ship of life, whose port is Paradise,
And freighted full of love you steer for Home.
