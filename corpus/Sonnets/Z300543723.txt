Our bodily life, some plead, that life the shrine
Of and immortal spirit, is a gift
So sacred, so informed with light divine,
That no tribunal, though most wise to sift
Deed and intent, should turn the Being adrift
Into that world where penitential tear
May not avail, nor prayer have for God's ear
A voice -- that world whose veil no hand can lift
For earthly sighed. "Eternity and Time"
They urge, "have interwoven claims and rights
Not to be jeopardised through foulest crime:
The sentence rule by mercy's heavenborn lights."
Even so; but measuring not by finite sense
Infinite Power, perfect Intelligence.
