Not the slow Hearse, where nod the sable plumes,
    The Parian statue, bending over the Urn,
    The dark robe floating, the dejection worn
    On the dropped eye, and lip no smile illumes;
Not all this pomp of sorrow, that presumest
    It pays Affection's debt, is due concern
    To the for Ever Absent, though' it mourn
    Fashion's allotted time. If Time consumes,
While life is ours, the precious vestal-flame
    Memory should hourly feed; -- if, through' each day,
    She with whatever we see, hear, think, or say,
Blend not the image of the vanished frame,
    O! can the alien heart expect to prove,
    In world's of light and life, a reunited love!
