In the deep flushing of the Western sky,
The new moon stands as she would fain be gone,
And, dropping earthward, greet Endymion:
If Death uplift me, even thus should I,
Companioned by the silver spirits high
And stationed on the sunset's crimson towers,
Bend longing over earth's broad stretch of bowers,
To where my love beneath their shades might lie;
For I should weary of the endless blue,
Should weary of my evergrowing light,
If that one soul, so beautiful and true,
Were hidden by earth's vapours from my sighed,
Should wane and wane as changeful planets do,
And move on slowly, wrapped in mine own night.
