Some famous authors trade in mental sleep,
Lulling grown babies with a printed beebee:
Profound the learned them call, the vulgar deep:
Though over their pages none can laugh or weep,
And dull as coffined dust may he or she be,
Their dear no-meaning sells, and that's enough:
If I don't understand Sir Riddles' stuff,
Sir Riddles does -- how clever, then, must he be!
At shrines whose mysteries have gods of wood,
The age-long pilgrimage brings crowds to prey;
But in a month, a fortnight, or a day,
Dead drops that' immortal who is understood!
Clear as the crystal pane that fronts the north,
His worth is seen through, therefore nothing worth.
