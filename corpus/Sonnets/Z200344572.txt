Why do I plead for mercy unto thee,
    When from offence my life & soul are clear?
For in my heart I near offended thee,
    Unless the High pitch of his flight it were.
I that is it, I to too well consider,
    Thy sparkling beauty is the sun that melted:
My thoughts the wax that joined his wings together,
    And till my very fall I never felt it:
Despair the Ocean is that swallowed me,
    Where I Like Icarus continue drowned,
Till with thy beauty I revived be,
    And with loves immortality be crowned.
True love immortal is, then love me truly:
Sweet do, and then thy name Isle honour duly.
