Emaricdulf my Orphan muses mother,
    Pure map of virtue, Honors only daughter:
Bright gem of beauty, fair above all other,
    True badge of faith, foul ignominies slaughter,
Ensign of love, sour enemy to lust,
    The graces grace, fair Eretines disgrace:
Wrongs chief reprover, cause of what is joust,
    Aduices patron, counsels resting place:
Wisdomes chief fort, wits only pure refiner,
    Grave of deceit, the life of policy,
Fates best beloved, nature's true diviner,
    Nurce of invention, hold of constancy,
Poison of pain, Physician of annoys,
Eliziums pride, and paradise of joys.
