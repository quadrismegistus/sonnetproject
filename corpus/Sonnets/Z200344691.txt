Good Son of the best Father, whose wise lore
    And great example join thy breast to warm
    With generous emulation to perform
That arduous task, which He has set before,

Mine own George Onslow, oft reflect that more
    From thee the world expects, than from the swarm
    Of gay, mistutored youths, who never the charm
Of Virtue hear, nor wait at Wisdom's door:

View then the pattern with a steadfast eye,
    By thy great Ancestors from Sire to Son
        With a religious care transmitted down;
Firm to the cause of Truth and Liberty,
    In their fair steps the raze of Glory run,
        Equal their worth, and equal their renown.
