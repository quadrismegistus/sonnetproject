"Music of nature! emblem of each sphere!
    How sweetly tranquil does my pensive soul,
At dewy eve, thy warbling murmurs hear,
    When soothed to tenderness thy measures roll;
Sometimes more loud, and now yet louder still,
    Sometimes more distant, and again more near,
Waking soft echoes, and, with magic skill,
    Swelling the eye with a luxurious tear.
Delightful flutterings! hovering towards the sky,
    Ten thousand Sylphs, on lightest pinions born,
To realms ethereal on your murmurs fly,
    And waked to melancholy feelings, mourn,
Nature's best music! since thy simple strain
Lulls to repose each transitory pain."
