Ah! why have I indulged my dazzled sighed
    With scenes in Hope's delusive mirror shown?
    Scenes, that too seldom human life hath known
    In more than vision rise; -- but O! how bright
The Mind's soft sorceress poured her rosy light
    On every promised good; -- oft on the boon
    Which might at Fame's resounding shrine be wone,
    Then lanced its beams where all the Loves invite!
Now, with stern hand, Fate draws the sable veil
    O'er the frail glass! -- Hope, as she turns away,
    The darkened crystal drops. -- Heavy and pale,
Rain-drizzling clouds quench all the darts of day:
    Low mourns the wind along the gloomy dale,
    And tolls the death-bell in the pausing gale.
