When death, or adverse fortune's ruthless gale,
    Tears our best Hope's away, the wounded heart
    Exhausted, leans on all that can impart
    The sympathetic charm; its mutual wail
Sooths the sick soul. Ah! never can it fail
    To balm our bleeding grief's severest smart;
    Nor wholly vain feigned Pity's solemn art,
    Tho' we should penetrate her sable veil.
    Concern, even known to be assumed, our pains
    Respecting, kinder welcome far acquires
    Than cold neglect, or mirth that grief profanes.
Thus each faint glowworm of the night conspires,
    Gleaming along the mossed and darkened lanes,
    To cheer the gloom with her unreal fires.
