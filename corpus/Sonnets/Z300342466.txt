Triumphant Arches, Statues crowned with Baize,
Proud Obeliskes, Tombes of the vastest frame,
Colosses, brazen Atlases of Fame,
Phanes vainly built to vain Idols praise;
States, which vnsatiate Mindes in blood do raise,
From the Crosse-starres unto the Articke Teame,
Alas! and what we write to keep our Name,
Like Spiders Caules are made the sport of Days:
All only constant is in constant Change,
What done is, is undone, and when undone,
Into some other figure doth it range;
Thus moves the restless World beneath the Moon:
    Wherefore (my Minde) above Time, Motion, Place,
    Thee raise, and Steppes, not reached by Nature trace.
