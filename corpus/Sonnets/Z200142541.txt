Out of the golden valleys of old years,
    You have recalled so many a lovely thing.
Forgotten splendours glimmer when you sing,
With their long vanished light of mirth and tears.
Gay lovers flout their love's delicious fears.
    The proud swords clash for Charles, the rightful King,
    A woman weeps, and turns her "Silver Ring."
The "Men of Harlech" charge with level spears.
Yet I, crowned with my crown of vanity,
    Have been more happy when you sang and played
The songs wherein your art had succoured me.
    As starry note on starry note was laid,
Then my chained rhymes, by your designs set free,
    Flew heavenward on the radiant wings you made.
