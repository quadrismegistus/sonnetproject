Thrise happy he, who by some shady Grove
Far from the clamorous World does live his own,
Though solitare, yet who is not alone,
But does converse with that Eternal Love.
O how more sweet is Birds harmonious Mone,
Or the soft Sobbings of the widowed Dove?
Than those smooth Whisp'rings near a Princes Throne,
Which Good make doubtful, do the Evil approve.
O how more sweet is Zephyres wholesome Breath,
And Sighs perfumed, which do the Flowers unfold,
Tnan that Applause vain Honour does bequeathe?
How sweet are Streames to Poison drunk in Gold?
    The World is full of Horrours, Falshoods, Slights,
    Woods silent Shades have only true Delights.
