Woe worth the man, who in ill hour assayed
    To tempt that western frith with venturous keel,
    And seek what heaven, regardful of our weal,
Had hid in fogs, and night's eternal shade.

Ill-starr'd Hibernia! well art thou repaid
    For all the woes, that Britain made thee feel
    By Henry's wrath, and Pembroke's conquering steel,
Who sacked thy towns, and castles disarrayed:

No longer now with idle sorrow mourn
    Thy plundered wealth, or liberties restrained,
        Nor deem their victories thy loss or shame;
Severe revenge on Britain in thy turn
    And ample spoils thy treacherous waves obtained,
        Which sunk one half of Spenser's deathless fame.
