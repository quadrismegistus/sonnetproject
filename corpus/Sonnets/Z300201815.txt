But Nature where she gives must give in kind,
Grant to the rich and from the poor withhold;
And much that we in manifest behold
Is faint to some, while other some still find
Truths -- that to our sense are veiled and furled -- 
Published as light, notorious as wind.
But the old Mother moves about her fire,
Replenishes its flame and feeds the world
And so fulfils her births and offices -- 
Causal or consequential cares not she
Or ortive or abortive: her desire
Is but to serve, and her necessity.
The invention and authority are His,
In the whole passed or what remains to be....
