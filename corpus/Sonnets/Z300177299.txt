There have been earnest fancies in my soul,
    A wilder summons, -- deeper cares than these,
That now possess my spirit and control,
    Subduing me to forests and green trees.
Thoughts have assailed me in my solitude,
    Of human struggle! -- and within mine ear,
    Still and anon, a whispering voice I hear,
That mocks me with my feebleness of mood;
The puny toil of sung -- the idle dance
Of metaphor, and shadows of romance!
Points to superior struggle -- paints the cares
    Of Empire, -- the great nation in the toils
Of impotence, that still in blindness dares,
    And what it cannot elevate, despoils.
