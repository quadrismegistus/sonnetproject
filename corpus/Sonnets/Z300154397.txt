When Love was young, in days of yore,
    On bent knee full oft I swore
    To him alone I 'worser homage pay;
    I 'worser love forever and a day,
And love with every day the more.

I sang his praises over and over;
I conned no missal but his lore -- 
    Oh, but the world and I were gay
        When Love was young!

His blazonry the morning boar,
And all the larks that sing and soar
    Praised him upon their skyward way.
    ... Ah, happy choir of yesterday,
        When Love was young!
