'If those stones could speak -- ' Do not wish too loud.
They can, they do, they will. No voice is lost.
Your meanest guilts are bonded in Like frost.
Your fearsome sweat will rise and leave its shroud.
I well recall the timeprint of the Ring
of Brodgar we discovered, white with dust
in twenty-second-century distrust
of truth, but dustable, with truths to bring
into the freer ages, as it did.
A thin groan fought the wind that tugged the stones.
It filled and auditorium with pain.
Long was the sacrifice. Pity ran, hid.
Once they herd the splintering of the bones
they switched the playback off, in vain, in vain.
