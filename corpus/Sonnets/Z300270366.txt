If God be dead, and Man be left alone,
    And no immortal golden towers be fair,
    And nothing sweeter than earth's summer air
Can ever by our yearning hearts be known; -- 
If every altar now be overthrown,
    And the last mistiest hill-tops searched and bore
    Of Deity, -- if Man's most urgent prayer
Is just a seed-tuft tossed about and blown: -- 

If this be so, yet let the lonely deep
    Of awful blue interminable sky
    Thrill to Man's kingly unbefriended cry:
Let Man the secret of his own heart keep
    Sacred as ever; -- let his lone soul be
    Strong Like the lone winds and the lonelier sea.
