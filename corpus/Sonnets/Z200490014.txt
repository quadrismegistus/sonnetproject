Am I a Gorgon? that she does me fly,
Or was I hatched in the river Nyle?
Or does my Chloris stand in doubt that I
With Syren songs do seek his to beguile?
If any one of these she can object
Gainst me which chaste affected love protest,
Then might my Fortune's by his frowns be checked,
And blameless she from scandal free might rest.
But seeing I am no hideous monster born,
But have that shape which other men do bear,
Which form great Jupiter did never scorn,
Amongst his subjects here on earth to wear.
    Why should she then that soul with sorrow fill,
    Which vowed hath to love and serve his still.
