Who shall possess the whole of any flower, -- 
    Both petals, leaves, and fragrance that abides
    In the sweet golden core where God resides,
Casting that fragrance forth with lavish power?
Man does possess a woman for and hour: -- 
    Upon her ample bosom's roseate tides
    Softly and sweetly for a month he rides;
Then winter shakes the rose-leaves from his bower.

How shall we grasp in one excessive bliss
    The beauty and fragrance that the world has seen,
Even from the rose-red blossom of Eve's kiss
    To the rare laughter of the Egyptian queen,
    Enclosing, sacred shuddering palms atween,
The imperial pure significance of this?
