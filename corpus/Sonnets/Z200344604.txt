O Faith, thou sacred Phoenix of this age,
    Into another world from hence exiled
Diuorc'd from honour by unheedful rage,
    Pure virtues nest by hateful vice defiled:
Thou faith that callest thy surname Constancy,
    Christened above the ninefold glorious sphere,
And from the heavens derives thy pedigree,
    Planting the root of thy fair lineage there:
Let this thy glory be above the rest,
    That banished earth where thou didst once remain,
Thou yet mayest harbour in my mistress breast,
    So a pure chest pure treasure may contain,
And in her living beauty never old,
Seem Like a precious Diamond set in gold.
