Wray, whose dear friendship in the dawning years
    Of undesigning childhood first began,
    Through youth's gay morn with even tenor ran,
My noon conducted, and my evening cheers;

Rightly dost Thou, in whom combined appears
    Whate'er for public life completes the Man,
    With active zeal strike out a larger plan;
No useless friend to Senators and Peers:

Me moderate talents and a small estate
    Fit for retirement's unambitious shade,
        Nor envy I who near approach the throne;
But joyful see thee mingle with the Great,
    See thy deserts with due distinction paid,
        And praise thy lot, contented with my own.
