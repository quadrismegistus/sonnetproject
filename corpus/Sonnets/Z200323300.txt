Hayley, thy tenderness fraternal shown
    In our first interview, delightful guest!
    To Mary and me for her dear sake distressed,
Such as it is has made my heart thy own,
Though heedless now of new engagements grown;
    For threescore winter's make a wintery breast,
    And I had purposed never to go in quest
Of Friendship more, except with God alone.
    But Thou hast wone me; nor is God my foe,
Who, ere this last afflictive scene began,
    Sent Thee to mitigate the dreadful blow,
    My Brother, by whose sympathy I know
Thy true deserts infallibly to scan,
Not more to admire the Bard than love the Man.
