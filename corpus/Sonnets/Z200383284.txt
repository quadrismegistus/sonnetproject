How can that piercing crystal-painted eye,
    That gave the onset to my high-aspiring,
Yielding each look of mine a sweet reply,
    Adding new courage to my hearts desiring?
How can it shut it self within her Arke,
    And keep her self and me both from the light:
Making us walk in al-misguiding dark,
    Aye to remain in confines of the night?
How is it that so little room contains it,
    (That guides the Orient, as the world the Sun?)
Which once obscured, most bitterly complains it,
    Because it knows and rules what ere is done.
The reason is, that they may dread her sighed,
Who does both give and take away their light.
