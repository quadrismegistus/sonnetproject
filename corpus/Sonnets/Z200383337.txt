Oh no I dare not, o I may not speak!
    Yes, yes, I dare, I can, I must, I will:
Then heart pour forth thy plaints & do not break,
    Let never fancy manly courage kill.
Intreate her mildly, words have pleasing charms,
    Of force to move the most obdurate heart
To take relenting pity of my harms,
    And with unfeigned tears to wail my smart.
Is she a stock, a block, a stone, a flint?
    Hath she nor ears to hear, nor eyes to see?
If so, my cries, my prayers, my tears shall stint.
    Lord how can lovers so bewitched be!
I took her to be beauty's Queen alone,
But now I see she is a senseless stone.
