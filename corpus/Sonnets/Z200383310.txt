Well may my soul immortal and divine,
    That is imprisoned in a lump of clay,
Breath out laments, until this body pine:
    That from her takes her pleasures all away.
Pine then thou loathed prison of my life;
    Untoward subject of the least aggrievance,
Oh let me die: mortality is rife,
    Death comes by wounds, by sickness, care, & chance
Oh earth, the time will come when i'll resume thee,
    And in my bosom make thy resting place:
Then do not unto hardest sentence doom me,
    Yield, yield betimes, I must and will have grace.
Richly shalt thou be entombed, since for thy graven,
Fidessa, fair Fidessa thou shalt have.
