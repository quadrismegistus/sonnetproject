Think'st thou no milder passion ever warms
    His bosom; that, although his years be few,
    As if besprinkled with the marble Due,
It is insensible to love's alarms?
Thou errest; for know, that beauty's power disarms
    That loftiness of nature: he hath knelt
    To genius clothed in brightness, yea, can melt
Before the chastened glow of virtue's charms:
But angel, even 'amid angels, must she be,
    With bosom softer than the sacred dove,
    With glance Like lightning in the summer's even,
Who claims his worship for her deity.
For sacrifice, so worthy thee, O Love,
    Tis fit the kindling flame descend from heaven!
