Chloris, whilst thou and I were free,
Wedded to nought but Liberty,
How sweetly happy did we live?
How free to promise, free to give?

Then Monarch's of our selves, we might
Love here, or there, to change delight,
And tied to none, with all dispense,
Paying each love its recompense.

But in that happy freedom we
Were so improvidently free,
    To give away our Liberties;

And now in fruitless Sorrow pine,
At what we are, what might have been,
    Had thou, or I, or both been wise.
