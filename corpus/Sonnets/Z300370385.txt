Stars we meshed in coral trees of Spring
jumped Like fish while we reaped hay moon-
rise passed ecstasy, felt then as tears
or plucked dream berries with noon
eyes through whole days interlocked with spheres.
The net was torn.
You knew I did not dare be young,
yet did not know your sighed was prayer
to give such winged cries as belong
beneath a tiger lily's tongue.
The net was emptied soon.

Your eyes taught my eyes clarity
and both were vessels filled with sung
whose words unraveled the unemptied web.
