Courted by Cupid's, and the Amorous Air,
    Upon a shady Throne, at her Repose,
She sat, than whom, none ever so sweet or fair;
    It was the Queen of Flowers, the Blushing Rose.

With no less pride, upon his Bed of State,
    A Lily, pale with Envy, looked that way;
With humble Flowers, encompassed round he sat,
    And scorned the Scepter at her Feet to lay.

To Arms, with Thorns and Prickles, they prepare,
And each designs to try it out by War;
    Till on good Counsel, they in Rule combine:
So in your Face, the lovely White and Red,
Cynthia, I see, all Quarrels banished,
    And Rose and Lily do in Empire join.
