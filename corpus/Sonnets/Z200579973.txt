You keep the cold from the body, the cold from the mind.
Heartscloth, soulswool, without you there would be
Short shrift for the pale beast in a winter's wind,
Too swift exposure by too harsh a sea.
Cold I have known, its sports pages adrift
Past frozen dodgems in the amusement park,
One crumpled Gauloise thumbing a late lift
Where Paris flamed on the defining dark.

You've herd the gravel at the window, seen
A lost figure unmanned by closing time.
More honour to you that you took him in,
Fed buns and cocoa, sweetness, the sought dream
Of warmth and light against your listening skin
And rocked him to a tolerable wisdom.
