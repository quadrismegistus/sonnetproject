How shouldst thou love, and not offend?
Why, Cloris, I will tell thee how,
As thou didst once, so love me now,
And lie with me, and there's and end.

Thou only art enjoined (my Sweet)
To keep thy Reputation high,
And that indeed is Secrecy,
Since all do err, though all not see't.

Then fairest, fearless of all blame,
That sacred Treasure of thy Name
Into my faithful Arms commit;

Thou once didst trust me with thy Fame,
I then was just and true to it,
And, Chloris, I am still the same.
