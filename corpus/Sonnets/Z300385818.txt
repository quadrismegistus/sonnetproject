Once early as the ruddy bashful Morn
Did leave Dan Phœbus purple streaming bed,
And did with scarlet streams East-heau'n adorn,
I to my fairest Cœlia's chamber sped:
She Goddesse-like stood combing of her hair,
Which Like a sable veil did cloth her round,
Her Iuorie comb was white, her hand more fair:
She straight and tall, her tresses trailed to ground;
Amazed I stood, thinking my deer had been
Turn'd Goddess, every sense to sighed was gone,
With bashful blush my bliss fled I once seen,
Left me transformed (as it were) in stone.
    Yet did I wish so ever to-have remained,
    Had she but stayed, and I my sighed retained.
