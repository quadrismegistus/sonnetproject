O gentle Sleep, come, wave thine opiate wing,
    And with thy dewy fingers close mine eyes!
    Then shall freed Fancy from her cell arise,
    And elves, and fairies dance in airy ring
Before her sighed, and melting visions bring
    Of virgin love, pure faith, and lonely sighs;
    While on the passing gale soft music die,
    And hands unseen awake the aerial string.
Ye dreams, to me than waking bliss more dear;
    Love-breathing forms, before my view displayed;
    And fairy songs, that charm my ravished ear;
Let blackening cares my day with darkness shade,
    In smiling patience every wrong I'll bear,
    While you relume me with your nightly aid!
