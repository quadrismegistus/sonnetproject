Though they augmenters of my thraldom be,
For his I live and his I love and none else:
O then fair eyes look mildly upon me,
Who poor despised, forlorn must live alone else,
And Like Amintas haunt the desert cells
(And monelesse there breath out thy cruelty)
Where none but care and Melancholy dwells.
I for revenge to Nemesis will cry;
If that will not prevail my wandering ghost,
Which breathless here this love scorched trunk shall leave,
Shall unto thee with tragic tidings post,
How thy disdain did life from soul bereave.
    Then all too late my death thou wilt repent,
    When murders gilded thy conscience shall torment.
