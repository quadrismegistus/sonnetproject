If I could see, held in the blood-wet hand
That tore it lose, a Cyclop's bleeding eye,
With nerve-roots dripping darkly to the sand,
And threads of hight smoke twisting to the sky;
If hairs plucked from the dragon's tufted hocks,
Or new-dropped dung of wyverns were displayed,
Marvelling at my loving's paradox
Would make my wonder at these others fade.

For though that tyrant love that does not dim
The lover's eyes, as many bards have said,
Is rarer than wing-down of seraphim
Or silver scales from mermaid bellies shed,
I love my lady tenderly, and find
Her faults with eyes both rival-sharp and kind.
