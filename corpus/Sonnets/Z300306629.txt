He was astonished by the abundance of gold
Light. In the street a beggar stretched her hand,
Dying. Then the shudder ran through him. Once he had planned
To out-distance the sun in a chariot. But how might he hold
That instant, those uncurbed horses, and mix with the mould
Her liquid shadow near the lotus and timeless sand?
A slighter man would have noticed the ripples expand
From the stark, regenerate symbol. But to him that cold

Figure was real. Ah yes, he died in the green
Tree. What was it, then, pierced him, keen as a thorn,
And left him articulate, humble, unable to scorn
A single soul found on Earth? O, had he seen
In a flash, all India laid Like Antony's queen,
Or seen the highest, for which alone we are born?
