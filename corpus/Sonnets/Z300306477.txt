Crystalline scribe of the pure Parousia, chronicling passion's tale
Of Logres, giver of questing knights, deliver from sorcery's hands
The chivalry of the star-plucked heavens; reveal, where Galahad stands
Near the wolf in the forest of Broceliande, Taliesin the nightingale
Soothing Helayne in the night of labour, divining the labouring sail
Of the song-borne ship, and invoking her joy, her infant in swaddling-bands,
Substitution's fruit, to Blanchefleur carried, foretelling that union of lands
Which wone, through Lancelot's son, the grandeur and grace of the Grail.

You still of that excellent absurdity jealously guard the key
Which maps the just, geometrical heavens for King Arthur's avatars
In a luminous pattern, a network of roads, Jerusalem carried by sea
In a ship, and Byzantium's womanlike Europe pondering above her wars
Those time-consuming acts of identity narrowing to make men free,
Intricate watcher, catcher of men, in a net drawn close to the stars.
