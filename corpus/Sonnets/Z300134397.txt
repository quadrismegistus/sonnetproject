A Slav philosopher in Stronachlachar:
Vladimir Solovyov looked down the loch.
The sun was shimmering on birk and sauch.
'This beats the fishy vennels of St Machar,'
he said, and added, 'Inversnaid tomorrow!'
A boatman rowing to him from infinity
turned out to be a boatwoman. 'Divinity!'
he cried, 'shake back your hair, and shake back sorrow!'
The boat was grounded, she walked passed him singing.
To her, he was a man of forty, reading.
Within him the words mounted: 'Sing for me,
dancing Like Wisdom before the Lord, bringing
your mazy unknown waters with you, seeding
the Northern Lights and churning up the sea!'
