Then they were running with fire in their hair,
men and women were running everywhere,
women and children burning everywhere,
ovens of death were falling from the air.
Lucky seemed those at the heart of the blast
who left no flesh or ash or blood or bone,
only a shadow on dead Glasgow's stone,
when the black angel had gestured and passed.
Rhu was a demons' pit, Faslane a grave;
the shattered basking sharks that thrashed Loch Fine
were their killer's tocsin: 'Where I am, watch;
when I raise one arm to destroy, I save
none; increase, multiply; vengeance is mine;
in no universe will man find his match.'
