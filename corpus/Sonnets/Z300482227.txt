Behold the day and image of the year!
    The year and image of our life's short span!
    Morn, Like the Spring, with growing light began,
    Spring, Like our youth, with joy, and beauty fair;
Noon picturing Summer; -- Summer's ardent sphere
    Manhood's gay portrait. -- Eve, Like Autumn, won,
    Autumn resembling faded age in man;
    Night, with its silence, and its darkness drear,
Emblem of Winter's frore and gloomy reign,
    When torpid lie the vegetative powers;
    Winter, so shrunk, so cold, reminds us plain
Of the mute grave, that over the dim corpse lours;
    There shall the weary rest, nor aught remain
    To the pale slumberer of life's checkered hours!
