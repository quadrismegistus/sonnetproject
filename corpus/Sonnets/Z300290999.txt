O what is wealth, in pride of heart, he said,
    Compar'd with you, you treasures of the mind?
    O what the tinsel toys, in which arrayed,
    The rich man strives the eye of Sense to blind?
In these refreshing lawns, this haunted shade,
    How oft has Fancy splendid forms designed;
    Whose gleams before that' enraptured sighed displayed,
    Would leave the glare of Eastern Kings behind!
Can Wealth, the head to from, the heart to feel,
    The soul, that lifts the man to Heaven, bestow?
    The power, from Grief, Scorn, Malice, to appeal,
And loose, in dreams of bliss, Revenge's blow? -- 
    No fears then, Poverty, canst thou inspire,
    Give but the vigorous head, the soul entire!
