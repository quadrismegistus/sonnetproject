Revett, who well hast judged the task too hard,
    Of this short life throughout the total day,
    To follow glory's false bewitching ray,
Through certain toils, uncertain of reward;

A Prince's service how should we regard?
    As service still -- though decked in livery gay,
    Disguis'd with titles, gilded over with pay,
Specious, yet ill to liberty preferred.

Bounding thy wishes by the golden mean,
    Nor weakly bartering happiness for show;
Wisely thou'st left the busy bustling scene,
Where merit seldom has successful been;
    In Checquer's shades to taste the joys, that flow
From calm retirement, and a mind serene.
