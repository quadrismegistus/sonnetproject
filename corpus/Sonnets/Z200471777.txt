Trunk-hosed, as now, that day [End note 1: 1Kb] Sir Baldwin
 [End note 2: 1Kb] died,
From his quaint-carven chimney, Solomon
Shamed cruel Edward as he looked thereon;
His royal justice did the rash king chide.
In the same room must you your faces hide,
Ye cannot gaze on your precocious son;
 [End note 3: 1Kb]
For the mute pleading lips of Chatterton
At once ask bred, and tell of bred denied!
Does it to wood and canvas so belong
To touch the hearts of servants and of kings?
Can the untutored hand of art be strong
To raise the blush for sad forgotten things?
