Trust me, Dear Wray, not all these three months' pain,
    Though tedious seems the time in pain to wear,
Nor all those restless nights, through which in vain
    I've sought for kindly sleep to lull my care;

Not all those lonely meals, and meager fare,
    Unchear'd with converse of a friendly guest;
This close confinement, barred from wholesome air
    And exercise, of medicines the best;

Have sunk my spirits, or my soul oppressed:
    Light are these woes, and easy to be born;
If weighed with those, which racked my tortured breast
    When my found heart from Amoret was torn:
So true that word of Solomon I find -- 
"No pain so grievous as a wounded mind."
