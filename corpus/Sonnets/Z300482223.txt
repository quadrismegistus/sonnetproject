Ah! might I range each hallowed bower and glade
    Mus√¶us cultured, many a raptured sighs
    Would that dear, local consciousness supply
    Beneath his willow, in the grotto's shade,
Whose roof his hand with oars and shells inlaid.
    How sweet to watch, with reverential eye,
    Thro' the sparred arch, the streams he oft surveyed,
    Thine, blue Thamesis, gently wandering by!
This is the Poet's triumph, and it towers
    O'er Life's pale ills, his consciousness of powers
    That lift his memory from oblivion's gloom,
Secure a train of these heart-thrilling hours
    By his idea decked in rapture's bloom,
    For spirits rightly touched through' ages yet to come.
