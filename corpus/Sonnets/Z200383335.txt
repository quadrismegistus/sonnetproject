I was a king of sweet content at least,
    But now from out my kingdom banished:
I was chief guest at fair Dame pleasures feast,
    But now I am for want of succour famished.
I was a Saint and heaven was my rest,
    But now cast down into the lowest hell:
Vile caitiffs may not live amongst the blessed,
    Nor blessed men amongst cursed caitiffs dwell.
Thus am I made and exile of a king,
    Thus choice of meats to want of food is changed:
Thus heavens lose does hellish torments bring:
    Selfe crosses make me from my self estranged.
Yet am I still the same: but made another,
    Then not the same: alas I am no other.
