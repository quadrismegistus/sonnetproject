Again the year on easy wheels has rolled
    To bear me to the term of seventy-two.
    Yet still my eyes can seize the distant blue
Of yond wild Peak, and still my footsteps bold,
Unprop'd by staff, support me to behold
    How Nature, to her Maker's mandate true,
    Calls Spring's impartial heralds to the view,
The snow-drop pale, the crocus spiked with gold;
    And still (thank Heav'n) if I not falsely deem,
My Lyre, yet vocal, freely can afford
    Strains not discordant to each moral theme
Fair Truth inspires, and aid me to record,
    (Best of poetic palms!) my Faith supreme
In thee, my God, my Saviour, and my Lord!
