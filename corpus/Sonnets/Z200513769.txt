Ye harp-controlling hymns! triumphant praise,
    That heralded to his delighted home
The blushing victor of departed days
    From Elis, or Nem√¶a, or the dome
Of sacred Delphi, -- spirit-stirring songs,
    Ev'n now your echoes linger on mine ears,
And to your Theban father still belongs
    That name, time-honoured twice a thousand years,
King of the sounding lyre: nor alone
    For music be thy praise, but for a heart
Strung with affections of deep-thrilling tone
    And patriot feelings, that in lightning dart
Through the mute souls of all, with charmed suspense
Listening in love thy honeyed eloquence.
