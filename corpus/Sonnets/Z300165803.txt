A yellow sunset, soft and dreamy of die,
    Met sharply by black fluctuant lines of grass;
    A river, glimmering Like illumined glass,
And narrowing till it ends in distant sky;
Pale scattered pools of luminous rain, that lie
    In shadowy amplitudes of green morass;
    A crescent that the old moon, as moments pass.
Has turned to a silver acorn hung on high!

Now through this melancholy and silent land
    Sleep walks, diaphanous-vestured, vaguely fair.
Within her vaporous robe and one dim hand
    Much asphodel and lotus does she bear,
Going lovely and low-lidded, with a band
    Of dull-red poppies amid her dull-gold hair!
