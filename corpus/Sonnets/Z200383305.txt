Fly to her heart, hover about her heart,
With dainty kisses mollify her heart:
Pierce with thy arrows her obdurate heart,
With sweet allurements ever move her heart.
At midday and at midnight touch her heart,
Be lurking closely, nestle about her heart:
With power, (thou art a God) command her heart,
Kindle thy coals of love about her heart,
Yea even into thy self transform her heart.
Ah she must love, be sure thou have her heart,
And I must die, if thou have not her heart.
Thy bed (if thou rest well) must be her heart:
He hath the best part sure that hath the heart:
What have I not, if I have but her heart?
