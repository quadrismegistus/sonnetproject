I love to rise ere gleams the tardy light,
    Winter's pale dawn; -- and as warm fires illume,
    And cheerful tapers shine around the room,
    Thro' misty windows bend my musing sighed
Where, round the dusky lawn, the mansions white,
    With shutters closed, peer faintly through' the gloom,
    That slow recedes; while yond gray spires assume,
    Rising from their dark pile, and added height
By indistinctness given. -- Then to decree
    The grateful thoughts to God, ere they unfold
    To Friendship, or the Muse, or seek with glee
Wisdom's rich page: -- O, hours! more worth than gold,
    By whose blessed use we lengthen life, and free
    From drear decays of age, outlive the old!
