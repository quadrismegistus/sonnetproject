Williams, thou seest true poetry destroyed,
The weak mind caught by novelties instead;
Fame, for a day, by plagiarists enjoyed,
Who scruple not from the full veins to bleed
Our lusty ancients; envy with keen eyes
Watchful by timely ridicule to cast
A blot on genius, while the town denies
(Too indolent to judge) his claim to praise:
The Muses of the Drama, shackled fast
In lucre's bonds, or by the vain selflove
Of wretched managers, forbid the bays;
While they, and shallow farce-wrights only, prove
How poor, how basely frivolous the times,
In which I print, but publish not my rhimes.
