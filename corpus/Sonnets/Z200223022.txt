Who is it who comes to me from the Sabbath
dry-eyed covered with care? Who wakes for me?
To be born is to be Jewish. My Lord & My Lady were so,
I chosen their clarity in all this general forest.
The woods of Are. I am grateful. Dark linen
of the bed, shadows of earlier passion, you smell me
of us both. Sound of far trickling woke me,
as if a pipe were freezing or thawing. Or water spoke
its own name & woke me. My eyes are dry. Was I trying
to see in the dark as I slept? Read, & there was no text?
Who is the text speaks out of the Sabbath
& reads me awake, dry-eyed till the morning star,
Like King David above whose bed a lute was hung
that woke him with its music when the north wind blue?
