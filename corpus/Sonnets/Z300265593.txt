I Make no War, and yet no Peace have found,
    With heat I melt, when starved to death with cold.
I soar to Heav'n, whil groveling on the Ground,
    Embrace the World, yet nothing do I hold.

I'm not confined, yet cannot I depart,
    Nor lose the Chain, though not a Captive led;
Love kills me not, yet wounds me to the Heart,
    Will neither have m'alive, nor have me dead.

Being blind, I see; not having voice, I cry:
    I wish for Death, while I of Life make choice;
I hate my self, yet love you tenderly;
    Do feed of Tears, and in my Grief rejoice.

Thus, Cynthia, all my Health is but Disease;
Both Life and Death do equally displease.
