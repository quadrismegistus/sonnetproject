If Love it be not, what is this I feel?
    If it be Love, what Love is, fain I'ld know?
If good, why the effects severe and ill?
    If bade, why do its torments please me so?

If willingly I burn, should I complain?
    If 'gainst my will, what helps it to lament?
Oh living Death! o most delightful Pain!
    How comes all this, if I do not consent?

If I consent, 'this madness then to grieve;
    Amidst these storms, in a weak Boat I'm tossed
Upon a dangerous Sea, without relief,
    No help from Reason, but in Error lost.

Which way in this distraction shall I turn?
That freeze in Summer, and in Winter burn.
