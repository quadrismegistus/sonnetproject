O give me music, for my soul is fainting!
Not the gay strains of laughter-loving mirth,
But those deep notes of feeling at whose birth
The heart overflows with rapture passed all painting!
Blend, O Musician! every tender thing
In Heaven and earth with thy low murmuring strain,
Till my sad thoughts in silence turn again
To the fresh fragrance of life's flowering spring!
I'm tired and sick of folly and the mad
Uproar of merriment, and all the vain
Laughter and babbling that around me reign -- 
The mean delights of meaner things that had
Never a noble thought. Oh, I would hear
Such music as waits on the dying year.
