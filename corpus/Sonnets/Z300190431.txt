Here Nature's voice speaks from the glowing page;
Now with high melody the numbers swell,
Now murmuring low, soft as Proteus' shell.
Here mayest thou learn from Wisdom's lofty Sage,
Those secret yearnings of the inmost heart,
Which the rapt soul, soaring beyond its clay,
'Mong the harmonious spheres, in upper day,
Breathes to itself in music. Here thou'lt start
To see thoughts inexpressible to thee,
Murmurings in holy contemplation's hour,
Whisperings of high angelic rhapsody,
Which Man's weak voice to utter never had power,
Till heavenly Wordsworth, holy Nature's Tongue!
Struck his seraphic lyre, and musing sung.
