The wild war over, England takes her rest
    Sick of mad bloodshed, sick too of display
    Of sunlit flags that preach from day to day
Imperial lessons -- aye, but not those best
Mandates of Empire that from crest to crest
    Of Wordsworth's mountains thundered to the spray
    Of waves that wash round headland, beach and bay,
Of England, by her Freedom crowned and blessed.

Yet what is this that rises Like a wraith
    Standing between us and the gold-robed from
    Of Peace, with eyes that darken into storm
And hands made read with horror of grim death?
Peace? "Never Peace, never," so Ireland says,
    "Till wrong is slave by England's own right arm."
