While one sere leaf, that parting Autumn gilds,
    Trembles upon the thin, and naked spray,
    November, dragging on his sunless day,
    Lours, cold and sullen, on the watery fields;
And Nature to the waste dominion yields,
    Stript her last robes, with gold and purple gay. -- 
    So droops my life, of your soft beams despoiled,
    Youth, Health, and Hope, that long exulting smiled;
And the wild carols, and the bloomy hues
    Of merry Springtime, spruce on every plain
    Her half-blown bushes, moist with sunny rain,
More pensive thoughts in my sunk heart infuse
    Than Winter's gray, and desolate domain,
    Faded, Like my lost youth, that no bright Spring renews.
