Oh! place me where the burning noon
    Forbids the withered flower to blow;
Or place me in the frigid zone,
    On mountains of eternal snow:
Let me pursue the steps of Fame,
    Or Poverty's more tranquil road;
Let youth's warm tide my veins inflame,
    Or sixty winter's chill my blood:
Tho' my found soul to Heaven were flown,
    Or though' on earth 'this doomed to pine,
Prisoner or free -- obscure or known,
    My heart, o, Laura! still is thine.
Whate'er my destiny may be,
That faithful heart still burns for thee!
