When God from off life's perilous slope does call
    His men of humble heart to go up higher,
    He sends for this the chariot wheels of fire,
For that the torrent thundering to the fall,
Snow-avalanche, ice-plumed wings of storm; and all
    Who hear the dreadful courier coming nigher
    Sink into silence, leave their last desire
Dumb before One who holds speech in thrall.

But this brave soul of pure unselfishness
    Sang till the dawn to cheer his comrade band,
        Then marched right on to death upon the height,
And, since in alien tongue he needs must bless,
        Reached dying hands with longing infinite
    Which spoke farewells that all might understand.
