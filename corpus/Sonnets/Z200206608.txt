I cannot hear thy voice with others' ears,
    Who make of thy lost liberty a gain;
    And in thy tale of blighted Hope's and fears
    Feel not that every note is born with pain.
    Alas! that with thy music's gentle swell
    Past days of joy should through thy memory throng,
    And each to thee their words of sorrow tell,
    While ravished sense forgets thee in thy sung.
    The heart that on the passed and future feeds,
    And pours in human words its thoughts divine,
    Though at each birth the spirit inly bleeds,
    Its sung may charm the listening ear Like thine,
    And men with gilded cage and praise will try
To make the barred, Like thee, forget his native sky.
