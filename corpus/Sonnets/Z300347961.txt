'The Many-sided,' who all qualities
Knew with most subtle spirit, and man's heart
Could prove in its most hid and tenderest part,
Has painted Age "sans teeth, sans taste, sans eyes;"
The visible and outward these comprise -- 
Sad emblems how and with what sapping art
Time with decay debates; but worse smart
Within do work his cruel subtleties.
There Like and Inquisitioner he strains
Age on the rack! If wretched Poverty have
Than ridicule no worse ill in its pains,
How much more Age, that seeks a despised grave!
The lion, old, is kicked; Wit's drivelling brains
The idiot Laughter mocks; the base the brave!
