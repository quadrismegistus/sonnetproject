Muscular man shall guard
The integrity of love
Against the travesty
Of fashion's trivial pose.
The steadfast man in love
Knows the true socket hard
And vision's majesty
Near to the bone he knows.
Let it be said this house
Was strong to entertain
The God while he was here,
For these are sacred vows
And destined to remain
When treasons disappear.
