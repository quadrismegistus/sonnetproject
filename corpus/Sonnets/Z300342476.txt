To spread the azure Canopie of Heaven,
And make it twinkle with those spangs of Gold,
To stay this weighty mass of Earth so even,
That it should all, and nought should it uphold;
To give strange motions to the Planets seven,
Or Jove to make so meek, or Mars so bold,
To temper what is moist, dry, hight, and cold,
Of all their Iarres that sweet accords are given:
Lord, to thy Wisedome nought is, nor thy Might;
But that thou shouldst (thy Glorie laid aside)
Come meanly in mortality to bide,
And die for those deserved eternal plighted,
    A wonder is so far above our wit,
    That Angels stand amazed to muse on it.
