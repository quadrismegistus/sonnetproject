Strong saturation of sea! O widely flown,]
Strong saturation of sea! O widely flown,
    Far winds of fall, your litanies of pain
    Moan Like the music of a wild refrain
    Heard through' the midnight of a feudal town!
Young night is lipped with jasper where the blown
    Burden of evening lights intensely wane,
    And, shuddering seaward from the tawny plain,
    Vague fold on fold the enormous dark comes down.
Gusty and fervid as the sleepless sea
    The passionate fancies of a formless fear
    Spring in my nervous brain Like monstrous flowers;
The night, the wind-chant work their will of me,
    And thoughts Like death-bells echoing far and near,
