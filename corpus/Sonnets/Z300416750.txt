Amid those hills, while yet, in clefts, the snow
    Chills the first breath of spring's salubrious gale,
    Clouds thick, and lowering more and more prevail,
And moans the penned up tempest dull and low.
The clouds advance; the swift blasts, as they go,
    Mountain and scar, and rocking wood assail;
    Confused murmurs rush athwart the vale,
And winter's eddying leaves whirl to and from.
Through slanting hail which scuds along the sky
    Pale nature gleams in unsubstantial hue,
    Th' eternal mountains vanish from the view, -- 
Now they burst sudden opening from on high,
    The fleet-winged tempest gathered and withdrew:
As swift gay sunbeams over the landscape fly! --
