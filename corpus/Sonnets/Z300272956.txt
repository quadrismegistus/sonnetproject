Sweet Thames I honour thee, not for thou art
    The chiefest River of the fairest Isle,
    Nor for thou dost admirers eyes beguile,
But for thou holdest the keeper of my heart,
For on thy waves, (thy Christal-billow'd waves,)
    My fairest fair, my silver Swan is swimming:
    Against the sun his pruned feathers trimming:
VVhilst Neptune his fair feet with water laues,
Neptune, I fear not thee, not yet thine eye,
    And yet (alas) Apollo loved a boy,
    And Cyparissus was Siluanus joy.
No, no, I fear none but fair Thetis, I,
    For if she spy my Love, (alas) aye me,
    My mirth is turned to extreme misery.
