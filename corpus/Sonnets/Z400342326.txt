Are these the flowery Bankes? is this the Mead
Where She was wont to pass the pleasant hours?
Did here her Eyes exhale mine Eyes salt Showrs,
When on her Lap I laid my weary Head?
Is this the goodly Elm did us overspread,
Whose tender Rine cut out in curious Flowrs
By that white Hand, contains those Flames of Ours?
Is this the rusling Spring us Music made?
Deflourish'd Mead where is your heavenly Hue?
Banke, where that Arras did you late adorn,
How look ye Elm all withered and forlorn?
Only sweet Spring nought altered seems in you:
    But while here changed each other thing appears,
    To sour your Streames take of mine Eyes these Tears.
