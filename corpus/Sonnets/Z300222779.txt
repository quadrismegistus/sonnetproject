There was bitter tea in my memory,
angels
I called on were slow to appear. Never appeared,
but have been all these days at my, in my, side:
incline to me, Harken
lean this way when you walk.
Could I have been mad? Could I be at times and empty house
jammed with furniture?
I'm a lion & lazy, that's
what the angels know (why they twist my tail)
& what I
doubt want anyone else to.
And those who guess are wrong.
The sky is pale today, but the trees blood & gold
