See withered Winter, bending low his head;
    His ragged locks stiff with the hoary Due;
    His eyes, Like frozen Lake's, of livid hue;
    His train, a sable cloud, with murky read
Streak'd. -- Ah! behold his nitrous breathings shed
    Petrific death! -- Lean, waleful birds pursue,
    On as he sweeps over the Don lonely moor,
    Amid the battling blast of all the winds,
That, while their sleet the climbing sailor blinds,
    Lash the white surges to the sounding shore.
    So comest thou, Winter, finally to doom
The sinking year; and with thy ice-dropt sprays,
    Cypress and yew, engarland her pale tomb,
    Her vanished Hope's, and aye-departed days.
