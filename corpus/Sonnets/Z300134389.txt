Damian, D'Amiens, Damiano -- 
we never found out his true name, but there
he crouched, swarthy, and slowly sawed the air
with large strapped-on bat-membrane wings. Below
the battlements, a crowd prepared to jeer.
He frowned, moved back, and then with quick crow struts
ran forward, flapping strongly, whistling cuts
from the gray heavy space with his black gear
and on a huge spring and a cry was out
beating into vacancy, three, four, five,
till the crawling scaly Forth and the rocks
and the upturned heads replaced that steel shout
of sky he had replied to -- left alive,
and not the last key snapped from high hard locks.
