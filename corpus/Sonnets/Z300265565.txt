Let others sing of Mars, and of his Train,
    Of great Exploits, and Honourable Scars,
    The many dire Effects of Civil Wars,
    Death's Triumphs, and Encomiums of the Slain.

I sing the Conflicts I my self sustain,
    With her (Great Love) the Cause of all my Cares,
    Who wounds with Looks, and fetters with her Hairs.
    This mournful Tale requires a Tragick Strain.

Eyes were the Arms, did first my Peace control,
    Wounded by them, a Source of Tears there sprung,
Running Like Blood from my afflicted Soul;
    Thou Love, to whom this Conquest does belong,
Leave me at least the Comfort to condole,
    And as thou woundest my Heart, inspire my Song.
