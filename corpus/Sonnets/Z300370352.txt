In the dead night we walk behind a hearse                                      1
zigzagging towards a dancing colonnade;                                        2
knee-deep, through dust of faded petals wade                                2
passed thornless flowers through thorns. Hear us converse:                1
"Whom do we mourn?" you ask me, half afraid.                             2
"I mourn for you, and whom I mourn, I curse."                               1
And, though I know my answer is perverse,                                    1
I do not know who the one was who prayed.                                  2

With dawn comes knowledge. The prophet in the fane           3
withered the valedictory spray we brought,                             4
and swept it out into the empty court.                                      4
By scorn in love, by charity in disdain,                                    3
our fragmentary fealties attain                                                 3
foreknowledge of the vacancy he sought.                                4
