Doe I unto a cruel Tyger prey,
    That prays on me as wolf upon the Lambs?
(Who fear the danger both of night and day,
    And run for succour to their tender dammes)
Yet will I prey (though she be ever cruel)
    On bent knee, and with submissive heart:
She is the fire, and I must be the fuel,
    She must inflict, and I endure the smart.
She must, she shall, be mistress of her will,
    And I (poor I) obedient to the same:
As fit to suffer death, as she to kill,
    As ready to be blamed, as she to blame.
And for I am the subject of her ire,
All men shall know thereby my love entire.
