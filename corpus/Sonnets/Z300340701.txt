See, Sir, how as the sun's hight masculine flame
Begets strange creatures on Nile's dirty slime,
In me your fatherly yet lusty rhyme
(For these songs are their fruits) have wrought the same.
But though the engendering force from whence they came
    Be strong enough, and Nature does admit
    Seven to be born at once, I send as yet
But six; they say the seventh hath still some maim.
    I choose your Judgment, which the same degree
    Doth with her sister, your Invention, hold,
As fire, these drossy rhymes to purify;
    Or as elixar, to change them to gold.
You are that alchemist, which always had
Wit, whose one spark could make good things of bade.
