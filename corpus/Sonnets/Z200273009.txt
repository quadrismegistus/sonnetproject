Lord, my dryrie foes, why do they multiply?
Me for to ruinate, sundry be covetous.
Him shields not the Godhead, sundry say to my Soul.
Th' art Lord most vigilant, wholly my succorer,
And in thee all my staying, shall be harboured:
Th' art my most valiant victory glorious.
To our Lord loud I cried: from holy place herd he me.
In graven new buried, scarce have I slumbered:
I rose to life again, through God his holiness.
I fear not furious multitude, infinite,
VVith compass labouring, my body for to catch.
Rise Lord omnipotent, help me, my champion,
Lord, thy deer radiant, righteous equity,
Hath squisde all my foes, falsely me ransacking.
