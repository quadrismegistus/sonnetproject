As men have loved their lovers in times passed
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace,
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last,
Who now lies here in and unseemly place.
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise
And stare on beauty till his senses drown;
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes
Such beauty as here walked and here went down.
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south;
Many have praised her, we alone remain
