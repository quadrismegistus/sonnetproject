Lo! modern critics emulously dare
    Ape the great despot; throw in pompous tone
    And massy words their true no-meaning down!
    But while their envious eyes on Genius glare,
While axioms false assiduously they square
    In arrogant antithesis, a frown
    Lours on the brow of Justice, to disown
    The kindred malice with its mimic air.
Spirit of Common Sense! must we endure
    The incrustation hard without the gem?
    Find in that' Anana's rind the wilding sour,
The oak's rough knots on every osier's stem?
    The dark contortions of the Sybil bear,
    Whose inspirations never meet our ear?
