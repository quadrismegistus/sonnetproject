Thy friend, whom thy deserts to thee enchain,
    Urg'd by this unexcusable occasion,
    Thee and the Saint of his affection
Leaving behind, does of both wants complain;
And let the love I bear to both sustain
    No blot nor maim by this division,
    Strong is this love which ties our hearts in one,
And strong that love pursued with amorous pain;
But though beside thy self I leave behind
    Heavens liberal and earth's thrice-fair Sun,
    Going to where stern winter aye does won,
Yet, loves hight fires, which martyr my sad mind,
    Doe send forth scalding sighs, which have the Art
    To melt all Ice, but that which walls her heart.
