And thou, Religion! how shall we behold
Thy abject state, as, sitting by the way
Men pass thee by with scoffs, and mocking say
"Behold her! she that was erewhile so bold,
Who held herself so lofty, and foretold
The wrath to come, and none dared say her nay!
Who built so high her temples; let her prey
And stir the stones thereof than hearts less cold!"
Thus shalt thou sit, poor Perdue! all alone;
The rapture from thy erst-upraised eyes fled;
Earthwards thy look, from brow the halo gone.
They that pass by shall spoil thee, science-led,
Now this, now that; till, scarce owned by thine own
Or recognised, thou shalt be left for dead!
