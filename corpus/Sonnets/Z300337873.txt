Ye praise the humble: of the meek you say
'Happy they live among their lowly bowers;
The mountains, and the mountain-storms are ours!'
Thus, self-deceivers, filled with pride always,
Reluctant homage to the good you pay,
Mingled with scorn Like poison sucked from flowers -- 
Revere the humble! godlike are their powers:
No mendicants for praise of men are they.
The child who prays in faith 'Thy will be done'
Is blended with that Will Supreme which moves
A wilderness of world's by Thought untrod;
He shares the starry sceptre, and the throne:
The man who as himself his neighbour loves
Looks down on all things with the eyes of God!
