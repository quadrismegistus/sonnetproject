Ah me! wish! the vision cannot last;
    And sad reality must undeceive!
    The painted shapes of Fiction's loom are passed;
    And Truth's dull hues with keener sadness grieve.
Yet shall the Muse a grace, though' mournful, cast
    O'er the deep sighs she taught the breast to heave;
    Shall turn to music every wailing blast;
    And light with fairy rays the darksome eve.
Weary of Hope; by cold Neglect subdued,
    No more though' Fancy imp her eagle plumes,
    Yet shall she sooth the melancholy mood,
And throw a smile on Disappointment's glooms!
    Soft are the woes, with which the lyric string,
    Unheard by mortals, makes the forest ring.
