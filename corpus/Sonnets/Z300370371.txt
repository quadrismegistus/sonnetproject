Indigo and Zodiac with tangent bubbles
to bubbles separate these cherished
arduously discovered you's and me's
who smell of resembled smells no longer
in sleepless nostrils; though, Like space-caressing
legs of a compass, the smile of pride
(centrifugal, from inside, out)
configurate immortal me's and you's.

Tenderly ruptured pride alone
builds up barricades of communion
where in many-eyed, unblinking stares
before the milkman clinks his jars
tangent foams of you's and me's collapse and fuse
from outside, in; one sapphire yet conscious spiral.
