Either the goddess draws her troop of loves
    From Paphos, where she erst was held divine,
And does vnyoke her tender-neckèd doves,
Placing her seat in this small papry shrine;
Or the sweet Graces through the Idalian grove,
Led the blessed Author in their dauncèd rings;
Or wanton Nymphs in watery bowers have wove,
With fine Mylesian threads, the verse he sings;
Or curious Pallas once again does strive,
With proud Arachne for illustrious glory,
And once again does loves of gods revive,
Spinning in silken twists a lasting story:
    If none of these, then Venus chosen his sighed,
    To lead the steps of her blind son aright.
