When two Arcadian squires [Footnote: 1Kb] in rhyme and prose
    Prick'd forth to spout that dilettanti lore
    Their Ciceronis long had threadbare wore,
Taste from his polished lawn indignant rose,
And cried, "as Pedants are true Learning's foes,
    "So, when true Genius ventures to restore
    "To Nature, scenes that Fashion marred before,
"These traveled Cognoscenti interpose
    "And prate of Picturesqueness, [Footnote: 1Kb] -- Let them prate
"While to my genuine Votaries I assign
    "The pleasing task from her too rustic state
"To led the willing Goddess; to refine,
"But not transform, her charms, and at her shrine
    "Bid Use with Elegance obsequious wait."
