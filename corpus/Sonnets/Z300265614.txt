Oh Time! Oh rolling Heavens, that fly so fast,
    And cheat us Mortals ignorant and blind!
    Oh fugitive Day, swifter than Bird or Wind!
Your Frauds I see, by all my Suff'rings passed.

But pardon me, 'this I my self must blame,
    Nature that spreads your Wings, and makes you fly,
    To me gave Eyes, that I my Ills might spy:
Yet I retained them to my Grief, and Shame.

Time was I might, and Time is still I may
Direct my Steps in a securer way,
    And end this sad Infinity of Ill;
Yet 'this not from thy Yoke, O Love, I part,
But the Effects; I will reclaim my Heart:
    Vertue's no Chance, but is acquired by Skill.
