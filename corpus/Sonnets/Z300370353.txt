Subject alone to lonely and sincere                                               1
allegiance to crown-and-robeless liberty,                                      2
he can submit to no authority, --                                                    2
yet he is wise in all he does revere,                                               1
and lovable, because his will is clear                                             1
and beautiful, because his mind is free.                                         2
In him, all admirable traits appear                                                1
and he is kindly, for he owns no fear.                                           1

A youthful Adam, fresh from Genesis,                                 3
standing in memory, with pectoral muscles bright                4
alabaster, dusted by morning's light;                                    4
comprised the Sodomites' antithesis, --                                3
and, could I be as he looked in my sighed,                             4
from friendship would arise a trinity.                                   2
