It is quiet on the walks at night,
Youth moves two by two, with scarce a word
Whispered to shatter the metronome of leaves
That ticks the river's sung. Only the bright
Fragment of laughter, coral tipped, is herd
To contradict the hush before swift stilled;
Love is a sung the blur of night believes,
A dreaming and a promise half fulfilled.

The cool sweet darkness of the earth is part
Of every breast; the warm stars hover near,
And living's cadences are far too dear
For thought, too sharp to hold within a heart;
Only the lights that will of wisp the distant shore
Echo the unreality endured before.
