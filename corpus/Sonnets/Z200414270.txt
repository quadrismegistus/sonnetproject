Ye gales, that gently sooth the smiling sky,
    And, stealing from the flowers their nectared dews,
    In many a wanton blandishment diffuse
The balmy shower of odours, as you fly;
Ye verdant vales, you springs that murmur by,
    Fit haunts, which amorous sorrow well might choose.
    Who bade so oft your echoes to my muse?
Each hope, each fear, that ruled the sung, reply.
Those conscious echoes I no more to tales
    Of tender woe shall wake: since over my mind
        Again firm reason holds her calm control.
    Yet, though no more to lonely grief resigned
        I wander here to weep, not less my soul
This cool, these murmurs loves, and verdant vales.
