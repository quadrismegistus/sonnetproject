Pitfield, who on a length of years well-spent
Contemplative, or active, canst reflect
With secret pleasure; ever duly bent
With choicest care, and happiest, to select
Thy books, amusements, friends, a liberal plan
Hath aye been thine, a course exalting man.
Yet, the soft passion unindulged, might give
A doubt, if strains Like these could touch thy ear,
Had not, (or errs the muse?) a virtue warm
Guarding thy heart, forbid it's entrance there,
Fraternal love.  -- Had not thy breast alive
To pity, always felt it's influence kind,
Still true to generous friendships' nice alarm,
And with wide scope embracing all mankind.
