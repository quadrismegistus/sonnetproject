With Hairs, which for the Wind to play with, hung,
    With her torn Garments, and with naked Feet,
    Fair Lydia dancing went from Street to Street,
Singing with pleasant Voice her foolish Song.

On her she drew all Eyes in every Place,
    And them to Pity by her Pranks did move,
    Which turned with gazing longer into Love,
By the rare Beauty of her charming Face.

In all her Frenzyes, and her Mimickries,
While she did Natures richest Gifts despise,
    There active Love did subtly play his part.

Her antic Postures made her look more gay,
Her Ragged Cloaths her Treasures did display,
    And with each Motion she insnar'd a Heart.
