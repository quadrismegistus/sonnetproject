My cruel Fortune's clouded with a frown,
    Lurke in the bosom of eternal night:
My climbing thoughts are basely haled down,
    My best devices prove but after-sight.
Poor outcast of the world's exiled room,
    I live in wilderness of deep lament:
No hope reserved me but a hopeless tomb,
    When fruitless life, and fruitful woes are spent.
Shall Ph≈ìbus hinder little stars to shine
    Or lofty Cedar Mushrome leave to grow?
Sure mighty men at little ones repine,
    The rich is to the poor a common foe.
Fidessa seeing how the world does go,
Ioyneth with fortune in my overthrow.
