If ever tired Ulysses by this shore,
On such a day, above the laughing foam,
Had seen these dwellings clustered, thoughts of home
Had bade him sail the wine-dark seas no more;
Yon cape, with sunset colour powdered over,
Had been to him Leucimne: thither come,
He would have vowed such vows as men who rome
Vow safe-returned, and hung to Zeus and oar.
Thereafter, as he strolled, the dark-lipped caves
For him should have been full of oracle;
And, dreaming haply of the Chersonese,
The sea would, in compassion, cease to swell,
And gorgeous seaweeds, from beneath the waves,
Would float, as here, in wealth of golden fleece.
