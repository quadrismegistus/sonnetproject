These waves no way in his to sink can find
To penetrate the pith of contemplation,
These tears cannot dissolve his hardened mind,
Nor move his heart on me to take compassion:
O then poor Coryne scorned and quite despised,
Loath now to live since life procures thy woe,
Enough thou hast thy heart anatomized
For his sweet sake which will no pity shoe:
But as cold winter's storms and nipping frost,
Can never change sweet Amaranthus hue,
So though my love and life by his are crossed;
My heart shall still be constant firm and true.
    Although Erynnis hinders Hymen's rites,
    My fixed faith against oblivion fites.
