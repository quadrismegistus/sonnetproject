Slide soft fair Forth, and make a crystal Plain,
Cut your white Locks, and on your foamy Face
Let not a Wrinckle be, when you embrace
The Boat that Earths Perfections does contain.
Winds wonder, and through wondering hold your Peace,
Or if that ye your Hearts cannot restrain
From sending Sighs, moved by a Lovers Case,
Sighs, and in her fair Hair your selves enchain:
Or take these Sighs which Absence makes arise
From mine oppressed Brest and wave the Sailes,
Or some sweet Breath new brought from Paradise:
Floods seem to smile, Love over the Winds preueails,
    And yet hudge Waves arise, the Cause is this,
    The Ocean strives with Forth the Boat to kiss.
