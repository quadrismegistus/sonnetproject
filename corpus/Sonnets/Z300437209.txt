Ye hollow ruins, naked now and hoar,
With reverence thy lonely halls I trace,
And tread thy echoing vaults with solemn pace;
Whilst I those scenes of former pomp explore,
I pay a sighs to heroes dead of yore;
Whilst from a jutting pinnacle I hear
The Raven scream, and mark these chambers drear,
Where the loud harp was vocal heretofore;
And Iron chiefs, read from the recent war,
Would lay their arms aside, and frontlets grim,
And stoop to love, toying with damsels trim;
Or at the board enjoy the festive roar,
Whilst thronging vassals hailed the bidden guest:
O! day too short for such a night of rest.
