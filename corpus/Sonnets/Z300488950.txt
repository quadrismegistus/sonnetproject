The poet's fancy takes from Flora's realm
    Her buds and leaves to dress fictitious powers,
With the green olive shades Minerva's helm,
    And gives to Beauty's Queen the Queen of flowers.
But what gay blossoms of luxuriant Spring,
    With rose, mimosa, amaranth entwined,
Shall fabled Sylphs and fairy people bring,
    As a just emblem of the lovely mind?
In vain the mimic pencil tries to blend
    The glowing die that dress the flowery raze,
        Scented and coloured by and hand divine!
Ah! not less vainly would the Muse pretend
    On her weak lyre, to sing the native grace
    And native goodness of a soul Like thine!
