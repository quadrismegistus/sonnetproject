The awful seers of old, who wrote in words
    Like drops of blood great thoughts that through the night
    Of ages burn, as eyes of lions light
Deep jungle-dusks; who smote with songs Like swords
The soul of man on its most secret chords,
    And made the heart of him a harp to smite, -- 
    Where are they? where that old man lorn of sighed,
The king of sung among these laureled lords?
But where are all the ancient singing-spheres
    That burst through chaos Like the summer's breath
Through icebound seas where never seaman steers?
    Burnt out. Gone down. No star remembereth
These stars and seers well-silenced through the years -- 
    The songless years of everlasting death.
