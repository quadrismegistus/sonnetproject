Though you be fair and beautiful withal,
And I am black for which you me despise,
Know that your beauty subject is to fall
Though you esteem it at so high a prize.
And time may come when that whereof you boast,
(Which is your youths chief wealth and ornament)
Shall withered be by winter's raging frost,
When beauty's pride and flowering years are spent.
Then wilt thou morn when none shall thee respect:
Then wilt thou think how thou hast scorned my tears,
Then pitiless each one will thee neglect,
When hoary grey shall die thy yellow hears.
    Then wilt thou think upon poor Corins case,
    Who loved thee deer yet lived in thy disgrace.
