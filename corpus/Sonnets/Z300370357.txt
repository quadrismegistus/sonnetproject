Did no unseen pods cling to your coat by the river               1
boarding school, your innocence last wandered                    2
when its long remembering had lain fallow                           3
within my mind? That ghostly weed which burred                2
you was a me of me, unrecognized;                                      4
my college self who found others were shallow:                   3

When, catching his own glance, he analyzed                                  4
what stared so impolitely from the mirror,                                      1
he wondered if he earnestly despised                                             4
that callow face; or did he hold it dearer                                         1
because, unlike his classmates, he preferred                                   2
talk with autumnal women, ever mellow,                                        3
or boys, with whom his well-considered word                                2
not always marked him as a crazy fellow?                                      3
