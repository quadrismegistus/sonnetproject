Lady, whose fair approof I wish should give
    A glorious sanction to whatever I write;
    Since what your well-poised judgement marks with white
Secure from envy will to ages live;

So may I in this arduous emprise thrive,
    As I not follow in the chase for spite;
    But led by Love of True, and Fit, and Right,
In which good cause each gentle breast should strive:

While I with hazard of my own good name
    Like Calidore pursue the Blatant Beast
In dear defence of Ladies' honest fame,
Which his foul mouth profanely taints with blame;
    Let me, however with dread and dangers pressed,
Enjoy the smiles of every virtuous dame.
