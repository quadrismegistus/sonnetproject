I bid farewell into the world and thee,
To the, because thou art Extreme unkind,
Unto the world, because the world to me
Is nothing, since I cannot move thy mind.
Were any mercy in thy soul enshrined,
Could sighs or tears make soft thy flinty heart,
I could perhaps more easily be inclined
To spend my days with the then to depart.
But since thou knows not Cupid's golden dart,
But hath been wounded with a shaft of led,
It is but folly to pretend his Art
To sue for favour, when I find but feade.
    Soe farewell, Nymph, farewell for aye as now,
    And welcome death more merciful then thou.
