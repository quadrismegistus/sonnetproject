My forlorn muse that never trodden the path
    That leads to top of High Pierion mount,
Nor never washed within the liuesome both
    Of learning's spring, bright Aganippe fount:
Mine artless pen that never yet was dipped
    In sacred nectar of sweet Castalie,
My lovesick heart that ever hath I clipped,
    Emaricdulfe the Queen of chastity:
Shall now learn skill my Ladies fame to raise,
    Shall now take pains her virtues to record,
And honour her with more immortal praise,
    Then ever heretofore they could afford:
Both heart, and pen, and muse shall think it duty,
With sigh swollen words to blaze her heau&ebar;ly beauty.
