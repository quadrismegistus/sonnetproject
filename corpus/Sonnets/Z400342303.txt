That I so slenderly set forth my Minde,
Writing I wot not what in ragged Rhymes,
And charged with Brass into these golden Times
When others tower so high am left behind:
I crave not Phebvs leave his sacred Cell
To bind my Browes with fresh Aonian Baize,
Let them have that who tuning sweetest Layes
By Tempe sit, or Aganippe Well,
Nor yet to Venus Tree do I aspire,
Sith She for whom I might affect that Praise,
My best Attempts with cruel Words gainsays,
And I seek not that Others me admire.
    Of weeping Myrrh the Crown is which I crave,
    With a sad Cypress to adorn my Grave.
