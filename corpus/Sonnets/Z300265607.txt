Oh Death! without regard to wrong or right,
    All things at will thy boundless Rage devours;
This tender Plant thou hast cut down in spite,
    And scattered on the Ground its Fruit, and Flowers.

Our Love's extinct that with such Ardour burned,
    And all my Hope of future Pleasure die;
Nature's chief Master-piece to Earth's returned,
    Deaf to my Passion, and my grievous Cryes.

Sylvia, the Tears which on thy Sepulchre,
Hereafter shall be shed, or those now are,
    Th√¥ fruitless, yet I offer them to thee,

Until the coming of that' Eternal Night
Shall close these Eyes, once happy with thy Sight,
    And give me Eyes with which I thee may see.
