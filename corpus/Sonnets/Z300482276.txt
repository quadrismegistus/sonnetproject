He who a tender long-loved wife survives,
    Sees himself sundered from the only mind
    Whose Hope's, and fears, and interests, were combined,
    And blended with his own. -- No more she lives!
No more, alas! her death-numbed ear receives
    His thoughts, that trace the passed, or anxious wind
    The future's darkling maze! -- His wish refined,
    The wish to please, exists no more, that gives
The will its energy, the nerves their tone! -- 
    He feels the texture of his quiet torn,
    And stopped the settled course that action drew;
Life stands suspended -- motionless -- till thrown
    By outward causes, into channels new; -- 
    But, in the dread suspense, how sinks the soul forlorn!
