See Sir, how as the Suns hight Masculine flame
    Begets strange creatures on Niles dirty slime,
    In me, your fatherly yet lusty Ryme
(For, these songs are their fruits) have wrought the same;
But though the engendering force from whence they came
    Bee strong enough, and nature do admit
    Seven to be born at once, I send as yet
But six, they say, the seventh hath still some maim;
    I choose your judgement, which the same degree
    Doth with her sister, your invention, hold,
As fire these drossy Rymes to purify,
    Or as Elixar, to change them to gold;
You are that Alchimist which always had
Wit, whose one spark could make good things of bade.
