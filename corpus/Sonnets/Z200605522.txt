Died under the architecture of those he so hated,
The political structure of our European dictators,
Like a little boy in the clamped hand of fate,
Knowing he could gain nothing by death's example,
Who would have built me a home. I built now this poem
For him who, lost again, as in his dreams, saw amply
The shape of the still hand in the luckless grove,
This cold glory was nemesis to his love.
O no, Death is not ample, nor how bravely
He lived in a sinking ship sufficient reason
Who was so kind in life. For him this simple
Political moment held a new town Like a heaven
To be built by his kindly eyes, but his instructions
Failed, not for the future now, but for the present.
