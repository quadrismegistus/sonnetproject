Sleep brought me vision of my lady dead,
Robed as of old time in a silken gown,
With violets clustered round her perfect head,
And violets gathered where her robe fell down
Even to where her silken shoes were sewn
With dust of silver and stained purple thread;
Her vesture's die were something fainter grown;
And the dusk buds held memory of scents shed.

But in her face there seemed a heavier change,
As when a rose is ruined by long rain
And the rich hues show rust; a sorrow strange
Brooded within her eyes, and the wet stain
Tarnished her cheeks, as to mine own thought's range
She sighed: "There is no love where I have lain!"
