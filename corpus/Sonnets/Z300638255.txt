The Muses fairest light in no dark time,
The Wonder of a learned Age; the Line
Which none can pass; the most proportioned Wit,
To Nature, the best Judge of what was fit;
The deepest, plainest, highest, clearest Pen;
The Voice most echoed by consenting Men,
The Soul which answered best to all well said
By others, and which most requital made,
Tun'd to the highest Key of ancient Rome,
Returning all her Music with his own,
In whom with Nature, Studie claimed a part,
And yet who to himself owed all his Art:
    Here lies Ben: Iohnson, every Age will look
    With sorrow here, with wonder on his Book.
