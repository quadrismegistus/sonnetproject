Give me the Triple of thy horns and hoofs,
The ponderous undertones of 'bus and tram,
A garret and a glimpse across the roofs
Of clouds blown eastward over Notre Dame,
The glad-eyed streets and radiant gatherings
Where I drank deep the bliss of being young,
The strife and sweet potential flux of things
I sought Youth's dream of happiness among!
It walks here aureoled with the city-light.
Forever through the myriad-featured mass
Flaunting not far its fugitive embrace, -- 
Heard sometime in a sung across the night,
Caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass,
And when love yields to love seen face to face.
