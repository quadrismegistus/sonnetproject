Tongue never cease to sing Fidessa's praise,
    Heart (how ever she deserve) conceive the best:
Eyes stand amazed to see her beauty's rays,
    Lippes steal one kiss and be for ever blessed.
Hands touch that hand wherein your life is closed,
    Brest lock up fast in thee thy lives sole treasure,
Arms still embrace and never be disclosed,
    Feete run to her without or pace or measure,
Tongue, heart, eyes, lips, hands, breast, arms, feet,
    Consent to do true homage to your Queen:
Louelie, fair, gentle, wise, virtuous, sober, sweet,
    Whose Like shall never be; hath never been,
Oh that I were all tongue her praise to show:
Then surely my poor heart were freed from woe.
