O Time, rude Time! thou disenchanter; thou
Breaker of vows, foreswearer, juggler, cheat;
That contradictories, contraries, makest meet
With Judas-kiss, and innocent-seeming brow,
Ay, as of very Truth; who plightest Now,
Poor dupe, to Then, and weddest all in a heat;
And smear'st the edge oh' the cup of thy deceit
With Nectar, and beguil'st we know not how!
Are Love and Friendship but thy bait and snare
For hearts, as limed twigs for poor birds! Thee, thee,
With whom of the heart's freshness I did share
Th' overflowing cup, two rare wines mingling free,
I coldly pass; each greeting does forbear,
And (though both hearts are full) seems not to see!
