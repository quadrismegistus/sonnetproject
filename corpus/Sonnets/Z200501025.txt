She reigns! -- the Beautiful -- the Young, the Bright,
    And the old proud Ocean lifts up, in amaze,
    His many-centuried head on her to gaze! -- 
The youthful from, all loveliness and light,
Who wields his Stormy Sceptre, now aright! -- 
    To her be love and homage, and all praise;
    For surely that throned Virgin pure shall raise
The Land to yet more proud and palmy height:
    It seems as though that Land were governed now
Even by a bright commission from above,
    (Which Heaven in favour does to us allow!)
Sure Mercy, Innocence, Hope, Truth, and Love
    Are sent to rule us! -- so replete art thou,
Oh, Queen! with virtues -- charms -- graces, that all approve!
