Lighter and lighter, not eternity,
only a morning breaking on dark fields.
The sleepers might almost throw back those shields,
jump to stations as if golden pity
could probe the grave, the beauty was so great
in that silent slowly brightening place.
No, it is the living who wait for grace,
the hare, the fox, the farmer at the gate.
And Glasgow's windows took the strong spring sun
in the corner of a water-meadow,
its towers shadowed by a pigeon's flight.
Not daisy-high, children began to run
Like tumbling jewels, as in old Yeddo,
and with round eyes unwound their wild read kite.
