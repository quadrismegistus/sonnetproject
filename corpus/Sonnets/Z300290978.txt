Wand'ring amid deep woods, and mountains dark,
    Wilder'd by night, my comrades lost to guide,
    Oft through' the void I've raised my voice; and hark!
    The rocks with twenty mimic tones replied.
Within those sacred haunts, 'this said, abide
    Fauns, Nymphs, and Satyrs, who delight to mark,
    And mock each lonely found: but ere the lark
    Wakes her shrill note, to secret cells they glide.
Night-wandering noises, revelry, and joke
    Disturb the air, 'this said by rustics round,
    Who start to hear its solemn silence broke,
And warbling strings, and plaintive pipes to found:
    And oft they hear, when Pan his reed hath woke,
Hills, vales, and woods, and glens the harmony rebound.
