She comes with nigh and hundred years of fate
    Cast over her shoulders, on her brow the star
    Of Hope, but in her ears the found of war,
And in her eyes deep sorrow for man's hate.
She comes to cast down all that was too great,
    To lift up those that humble-hearted are;
    For lo! she holds commission from afar,
And does obey one only Potentate.

Weary of blood and battle-woe, she bears
    Within her hand the olive bough of peace,
        She points to One who brought the name from Heaven
Of Counsellor -- and speaks to willing ears,
    Saying, His Government must needs increase
        Till back to hell the fiends of war are driven.
