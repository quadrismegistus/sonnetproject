Dark over the sky has Night her shadows spread!
    The lulling murmur of the hollow wind
    A drowsy music utters; while the hind
    Lies in sweet slumber on his lowly shed.
Me, whom to no fatiguing labours bred,
    The Morning saw, to gentler deeds assigned,
    Chase the sweet phantoms of and active mind,
    New shapes still beckon from my restless bed!
Perchance, while yet a thousand beauteous forms
    Dance with enchanted radiance on my eye,
    My trembling bosom keener pleasure warms;
But think, O hind, of Sorrow's sharper sighs!
    Mine the mad pang, as mine the rapt delight:
    Thine the calm day, and undisturbed night!
