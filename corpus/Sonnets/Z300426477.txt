Smooth, simple Path! whose undulating line,
    With sidelong tufts of flowery fragrance crowned,
    "Plain in its neatness," [Footnote: 1Kb] spans my garden ground;
What, though two acres thy brief course confine,
Yet sun and shade, and hill and dale are thine,
    And use with beauty here more surely found,
    Than where, to spread the picturesque around,
Cart ruts and quarry holes their charms combine! [Footnote: 1Kb]
    Here, as thou leadest my step through lawn or grove,
Liberal though limited, restrained though free,
    Fearless of Due, or dirt, or dust, I rove,
And own those comforts, all derived from thee!
    Take then, smooth Path, this tribute of my love,
Thou emblem pure of legal liberty!
