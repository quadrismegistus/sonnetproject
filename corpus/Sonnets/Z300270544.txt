Of all sweet names that sing in poets' ears
    I think thy name is sweetest. Soft and new
    It brought before me the broad Southern blue:
My dreams were sweetened by thy girlish years,
And hand in hand with all thy joys and fears
    I wandered thine enchanted uplands through,
    And saw the sunlight gild the wild "karroo,"
And saw thy lonely sweet eyes fill with tears.

I love the name, -- the very sweetest name
    It is that heart of poet ever sung.
    I love to hear it linger on my tongue
And feel that through the word the heart I claim:
    The heart so gentle, tender, and so young
And yet so full of force, and full of flame.
