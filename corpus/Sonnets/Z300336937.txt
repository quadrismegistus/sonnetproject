I was ashamed when some one said to me,
'How blue those mountains are, that cloud how fair' -- 
I could have praised them first: but could not dare
To mix false words with joy so pure and free.
And when they said, 'Behold that shining sea!'
I wept beneath my long and veiling hair;
Stung by the rapture which I could not share,
Long, long I wept, and unrestrainedly.
Stranger! if thou canst help me, help me now.
Beauty I saw of old wherever I gazed:
But now, Like one by light too brilliant dazed,
To me the loveliest things look blank and gray.
A cloud is on my breast, and on my brow -- 
Abashed I turn from fairest shapes away.
