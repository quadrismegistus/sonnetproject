"Blessings be with them, and eternal praise,
    Who gave us nobler loves, and nobler cares,
    The poets, who on earth have made us heirs
Of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays!
    Oh! might my name be numbered among theirs,
Then gladly would I end my mortal days."
Not in the shade of academic bowers,
    Nor yet in classic haunts, where every breeze
    Wakes, with its whispers, music among trees,
Which shelter by their shadow fragrant flowers;
Has it been mine to nurse my minstrel powers.
    Nor have I, lulled in literary ease,
    Dreamt of ascending, even by degrees,
The glittering steep where "Fame's proud temple" towers.
