You have in you the flowers and the green grass:
And what is shining or is fair to see:
Light of the sun your own light does surpass:
Who hath not seen you, worthless wight must be!
And in this world of ours, no creature is
So full of pleasure and delightfulness:
If any man fear love, new courage his,
Seeing your face, so much himself to bless!
The ladies all, that bear you company,
For your dear sake, are pleasing to my sighed,
And I would beg them of their courtesy,
To do you honour, each to strive her best,
And in your sovereignty to have delight
Since of them all you are the loveliest.
