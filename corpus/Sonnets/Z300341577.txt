Jackson! whose taste from nature's fountain springs,
Whence thy own stream of harmony proceeds;
Steering aloof, on firm and vigorous wings,
From vulgar sentiments, and vulgar deeds,
Offspring of prejudice; whose voice though taught
By seeming critic wisdom, and around
Re-echoed by the multitude, thy thought
Warps not, despising each unhallowed found.
To thee these strains I send, unmoved by fear;
For by the same pure waves I too have strayed
(Unless deceived) it's notes have pierced my ear;
While on it's banks young love with fancy strayed,
And all those forms which charm the feeling heart,
But seen through clouds, and wooed in vain by art.
