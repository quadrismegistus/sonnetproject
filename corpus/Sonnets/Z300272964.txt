A fairest Ganymede, disdain me not,
    Though silly Sheepeheard I, presume to love thee,
    Though my harsh songs & Sonnets cannot move thee,
Yet to thy beauty is my love no blot.
Apollo, Jove, and many Gods beside,
    S'daind not the name of c&ubar;try shepherd's swains,
    Nor want we pleasure, though we take some pains,
We live contentedly: a thing called pride,
Which so corrupts the Court and every place,
    (Each place I mean where learning is neglected,
    And yet of late, even learning's self's infected)
I know not what it means, in any case:
    We only (when Molorchus begins to peep)
    Learn for to fold, and to unfold our sheep.
