As are those Apples, pleasant to the Eye,
But full of Smoke within, which use to grow
Near that strange Lake, where God poured from the Skie
Huge showers of Flames, worse flames to overthrow:
Such are their works that with a glaring Show
Of humble Holiness, in Virtues die,
Would colour Mischiefe, while within they glow
With coals of Sinne, though none the Smoake descry.
Ill is that Angel which erst fell from Heaven,
But not more ill than he, nor in worse case,
Who hides a traitorous Minde with smiling face,
And with a Doues white feathers masks a Rauen:
    Each Sinne some colour hath it to adorn,
    Hypocrisy All-mighty God does scorn.
