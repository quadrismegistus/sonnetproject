Time was, beloved, when from this far-off place
    My words could reach thee, and thine own reply -- 
    Now thou art gone, and my heart's longing cry
Pursues thee, as some runner runs his raze -- 
Cleaves Like a bird the emptiness of space,
    And falls back, baffled, from the pitiless sky.
    Ah, why with thee, so dear, did I not die?
Why should I live benighted of thy face?

Thou wilt have sped so far before I come -- 
    How shall I ever win to where thou art?
Or, if I find thee, shall I not be dumb -- 
    With voiceless longing break my silent heart?
Nay! Surely thou wilt read mine eyes, and know
That for thy sake all heaven I would forego.
