Lawry, whose blissful lot has placed thee near
    To Wisdom's house, where thou mayest rightly spell
    Of the best means in Virtue to excel;
Science, which never can be prized too dear:

Where thy Great Patron, though in life severe,
    Is candid and humane, in doing well
    Constant and zealous, studious to repel
Evil by good, in word and deed sincere:

In this fair mirror see thy duty clear,
    Practice enforcing what his precepts teach;
        This great example study night and day;
If faithful thus thy Christian course thou steer,
    Though such perfection thou shouldst fail to reach,
        Thy generous effort sure rewards will pay.
