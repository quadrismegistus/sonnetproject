All is not right with him, who ill sustains
    Retirement's silent hours. -- Himself he flies,
    Perchance from that insipid equipoise,
    Which always with the hapless mind remains
That feels no native bias; never gains
    One energy of will, that does not rise
    From some external cause, to which he hies
    From his own blank inanity. -- When reigns,
With a strong cultured mind, this wretched hate
    To commune with himself, from thought that tells
    Of some lost joy, or dreaded stroke of fate
He struggles to escape; -- or sense that dwells
    On secret gilded towards God, or Man, with weight,
    Thrice dire, the self-exiling flight impels.
