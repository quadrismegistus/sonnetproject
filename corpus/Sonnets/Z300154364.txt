From some dim height of being, undescried,
    Shall I look back and trace the weary way
    By which my feet are journeying today, -- 
The toilsome path that climbs the mountain-side
Or leads into the valley, sun-denied,
    Where, through the darkness, hapless wanderers stray,
    Unblessed, uncheered, ungladdened by a ray
Of certitude their errant steps to guide?

Shall I look back, and see the great things small;
    The toilsome path, God's training for my feet,
        The pains that never had been worth my tears?
Will some great light of rapture, bathing all,
    Make bygone woe seem joy; passed bitter, sweet?
        Shall I look back and wonder at my fears?
