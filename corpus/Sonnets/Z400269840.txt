"I cherish the sweet hope she will not marry,
    Marry again, my love, my dark-eyed queen,
It may be memory of a man will tarry
    In heart of hers when I am bruised between
The sudden folding doors of violent death;
    I charge you, therefore, brother, safe to carry
Words wafted by her husband's dying breath;
    If aught there were that yet for me could parry
The silent stress of agony that awaits
My soul approaching close Death's darksome gates
    It were to know that she, my love, were true,
    The grave being found too feeble to undo
    The silken love-knot twined around us two,
Made strong for both by fingers of the Fates;
