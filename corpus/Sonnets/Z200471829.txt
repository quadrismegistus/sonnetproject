The strong Sun rolls to kingship in the sky;
He reigns alone, or will not reign at all,
In Heaven alone will sway the golden ball;
The Stars, his nearest nobles, bow and die!
With gay address smiles Madame Coquetry,
Till Miss perfumes, then how her pleasures pall!
With what a flow of bitterness and gall
The season's hero owns and equal by!
Ye daisy systems feel not envy's shame;
Your constellations no base suns eclipse,
Nay! when your stars show misted purple lips,
The dandelion dulls his orb of flame;
And while men wonder at your generous will,
Out bursts the sun, but leaves you shining still!
