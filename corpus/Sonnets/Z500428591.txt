Yon party zealot, ignorant as warm,
    Has taunted me with change -- a charge untrue.
    I never was one with that deceitful crew,
Who mean Destruction when they roar "Reform;"
My purpose ever to prevent the storm
    'Tis theirs to excite. The wholesome air I drew
    With my first breath was Loyalty. I grew
In childhood reverence of her sacred from:
And, as she beamed upon my youthful eye,
Link'd with her mountain sister Liberty,
    In holiest union, all the more she wone
    My love and worship; and so made me shun
The fellowship of those who madly try
    To rend asunder what heaven joined in one.
