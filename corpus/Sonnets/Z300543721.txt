Fit retribution, by the moral code
Determined, lies beyond the State's embrace,
Yet, as she may, for each peculiar case
She plants well-measured terrors in the road
Of wrongful acts. Downward it is and broad,
And, the main fear once doomed to banishment,
Far oftener then, bade ushering worse event,
Blood would be spilled that in his dark abided
Crime might lie better hid. And, should the change
Take from the horror due to a foul deed,
Pursuit and evidence so far must fail,
And, gilded escaping, passion then might plead
In angry spirits for her old free range,
And the "wild justice of revenge" prevail.
