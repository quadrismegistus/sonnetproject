But was it art? We asked the French, who said
La nature est un temple o√π less vivants
sont less piliers, which was at least not wrong
but did it answer us? Old Christo's head
rolled from its box, wrapped in rough manila.
'The pillars of the temple are the dead,'
it said, 'packed up and bonded into led.'
Jowls of hemp smelled sweet Like crushed vanilla.
But his descendant in her flying-suit
carefully put the head back in its place.
'Of course it's art', she said, 'we just use men.
Pygmalion God it inside out, poor bruit.
For all they've been made art, they've not lost face.
They'll lift the polythene, be men again'.
