High on the wall that holds Jerusalem
I saw one stand under the stars Like stone.
And when I perish it shall not be known
Whether he lived, some strolling son of Shem,
Or was some great ghost wearing the diadem
Of Solomon or Saladin on a throne:
I only know, the features being unshown,
I did not dare draw near and look on them.

Did you not guess ... the diadem might be
Plaited in stranger style by hands of hate ...
But when I looked, the wall was desolate
And the gray starlight powdered tower and tree:
And vast and vague beyond the Golden Gate
Heaved Moab of the mountains Like a sea.
