Oh let me sighs, weep, wail, and cry no more,
Or let me sighs, weep, wail, cry more and more:
Yea let me sighs, weep, wail, cry evermore:
For she does pity my complaints no more,
Then cruel Pagan, or the savage Moore:
But still does add unto my torments more,
Which grievous are to me by so much more,
As she inflicts them, and does wish them more.
Oh let thy mercy (merciless) be never more!
So shall sweet death to me be welcome more,
Then is to hungry beasts the grassy more:
Ah she that to affliction adds yet more,
Becomes more cruel, by still adding more!
Weary am I to speak of this word (more)
