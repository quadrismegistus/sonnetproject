O&wblank;, great meed shalt thou receive,
    Great meed of fame, thou and thy learned compear,
    Who 'gainst the sceptic's doubt, and scorner's sneer,
Assert those heavenborn truths, which you believe.

In elder time thus heroes wont achieve
    Renown, they held the faith of Jesus dear,
    And round their ivy-crown, or laureled spear,
Blush'd not religion's olive branch to weave.

Thus Raleigh, thus immortal Sidney shone
    (Illustrious names) in great Elisa's days.
Nor doubt his promise firm, that such who own
In evil times, undaunted, though alone,
    His glorious truth, such he will crown with praise,
And glad agnize before his Father's throne.
