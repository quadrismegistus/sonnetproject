Why dost thou say thy Heart is gone,
And no more mine, no more thine own?
But, passed retrieve, for ever wed,
By sacred Vow, t'anothers Bed?

Why dost thou tell me that I lie
Bound in the same perplexed tie,
And that our now divided Souls
Are cold, and distant as the Poles?

Do'st thou not know, when first our Loves
Were plighted in the secret Groves,
    Our hearts were changed with equal Flame,

Say, Chloris, then how can it be?
Could'st thou give me, or I give thee?
    No, no, our selves are still the same.
