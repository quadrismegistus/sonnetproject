That thou art fair exceeding all compare,
    Witness thy eyes that gaze upon thy beauty,
Witness the hearts thou daily dost ensnare,
    And draw to honour thee with lovers duty:
That thou art wise witness the world's report,
    Witness the thoughts that do so much admire thee,
Witness the heavenborn Muses that resort,
    And for their mistress meekly do desire thee:
That thou art both exceeding fair and wise,
    Witness the anguish of my silly heart:
Thy heavenly shape hath caught me by my eyes,
    Thy secret wisdom that gives art to art,
So circumvents me and procures my pain,
That I must die, unless thou true remain.
