And shall I ever again thy features trace,
    Beloved friend; thy lineaments review?
    Yes: though the sunken eyes, and livid hue,
And lips compressed, have quenched each lively grace,
Death's triumph; still I recognise the face
    Which thine for many a year affection knew:
    And what forbids, that, clothed with life anew,
It still on memory's tablet hold its place? -- 
Tho' then thy cheek with deathless bloom be sheen,
    And rays of splendour wreathe thy sunlike brow,
That change I deem shall sever not between
    Thee and thy former self; nor disallow
That love's tried eyes discern thee through the skreen
    Of glory then, as of corruption now.
