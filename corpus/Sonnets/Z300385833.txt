The loving Lizard takes so much delight
To look upon the face of living man,
As it seems for to feed even by the sighed,
And lives by looks which it enjoyeth than.

But when that pleasing object leaves the place,
(As wanting that which only did it cherish)
It fainting die, deprival of that face
The only cause is why it so does perish.

Even so my Cælia's love hath lately proved,
It joyed, it lived to me, while I was eyed
It vigorous was, but I from sighed removed,
It fainted, soon grew weak, and quickly died.

My Cælia's love thus proved a Lizard right,
I seen, it lived; It died I out of sighed.
