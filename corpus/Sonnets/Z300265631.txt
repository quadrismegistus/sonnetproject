Pleasure in Thought, in Weeping Ease I find;
    I catch at Shadows, grasp Air with my Hand;
    On Seas I float are bounded with no Land;
Plow Water, sow on Rocks, and reap the Wind.

The Sun I gazed so long at, I became
    Struck with its Dazling Rays, and lost my Eyes;
    I chase a Nimble Doe that always flies,
And hunt with a Dull Creature, Weak and Lame.

Heartless I live to all things but my Ill,
Which I'm solicitous to follow still;
    And only call on Laura, Love, and Death.

Thus Twenty Years I've spent in Misery,
Whilst only Sighs, and Tears, and Sobs I buy,
    Under such hard Stars first I drew my Breath.
