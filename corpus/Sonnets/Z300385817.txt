Whilst wandering thoughts unsettled in desire,
Did rove at random in the fields of love,
Where fancy found fair objects fit to fire
Frozen affection, choice did choice remove:
Cupid contemned taking it much at heart,
For spite his dams lose darling made delight me;
She leaving Venus taking Iuno's part,
With new chased thoughts, & fires 'begins to require me.
Proud Cytherea angry with her wench,
Seeks in my heart a hate of her to breed,
So blazed her faults, which soon my fires did quench,
But Malice still lights on the owners head:
    For this the ill that all her envy wrought;
    It made her chaste, me author of that thought.
