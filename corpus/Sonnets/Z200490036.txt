My fixed faith against oblivion fights,
And I cannot forget her pretty self,
(Although she cruel be unto my plights)
Yet let me rather clean forget my self,
Then his sweet name out of my mind should go,
Which is that' Elixar of my pining soul,
From whence the essence of my life does floe,
Whose beauty rare my senses all control,
Themselves most happy evermore accounting,
That such a nymph is Queen of their affection,
With ravished rage they to the skies are mounting,
Esteeming not their thraldom nor subjection,
    But still do joy amid their misery,
    With patience bearing loves captivity.
