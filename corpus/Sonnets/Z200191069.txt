O happy day! From morn till midnight tolled,
I passed the hours beneath my lady's eye;
And as the golden minutes fleeted by,
Life gained proportions vast and manifold.
Our souls became exalted; round us rolled
Airs winged by angels, and the stooping sky
Seemed more our home than this, where mortals lie
Hope-cheated, death-cursed, to God's promise cold.
As kindred souls, love-bound, just entering through
The gates of heaven, from joy to joy we paced,
Our timid wings unused, and interlaced.
At length a tempest caught us, over us blue
Flames and ecstatic instincts, and we flew,
We two as one, and dashed on God full-faced.
