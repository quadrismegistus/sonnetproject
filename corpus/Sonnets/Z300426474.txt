What! when the step of even-footed time
    Has led me one and seventy years along,
    Dare I attempt a second birthday sung,
And bid it tinkle in Petrarchian chime?
Shall I, impeded by the knots of rhyme,
    Venture to shoot the warp of verse among
    My blunted shuttle? Be it right or wrong,
I'll try, yet keep from pathos or sublime;
    For Hurd, the critic of my youthful lay,
And yet Right Reverend Censor, cries "Forbear!
    "Age should avoid, Like Infancy, to play
"With pointed tools; a Sonnet once a year,
    "Or so, my nod permits thee to essay."
Duteous I bow, yet think the doom severe.
