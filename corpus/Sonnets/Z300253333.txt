These hand-me-downs of Milton that I wear
I wear well, we are a family
baroque, ambitious for abundant joy
except that we are duteous and severe.
The fourteen verses of the sonneteer
are thoughtful about this anomaly.
In spite of us a passionate outcry
interrupts.
                 Things being what they are,
mostly we are indignant as we write,
God did not make the world to be the best
but man has monstrously insulted it.
