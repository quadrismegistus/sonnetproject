The stately Lion and the furious Bear
The skill of man does altar from their kind,
For where before they wild and savage were,
By art both tame and meek, you shall them find.
The Elephant although a mighty beast,
A man may rule according to his skill,
The lusty horse obaieth our behest,
For with the Curbe you may him guide at will:
Although the flint most hard contains the fire,
By force we do his virtue soon obtain,
For with a steel you shall have your desire,
Thus man may all things by industry gain;
    Only a woman if she list not love,
    No art, nor force, can unto pity move.
