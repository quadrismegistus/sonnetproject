Chaste Cynthia bids me love, but hope no more,
    Ne'er wish Enjoyment, which I still have strove
    T'obey, and every looser Thought reprove;
Without desiring her, I her adore.

What Humane Passion does with Tears implore,
    The Intellect Enjoys, when 'this in Love
    With the Eternal Soul, which here does move
In Mortal Closet, where 'this kept in Store.

Our Souls are in one mutual Knot combined,
Not Common Passion, Dull and Unrefin'd;
    Our Flame ascends, That smothers here below:

The Body made of Earth, turns to the same,
As Soul t'Eternity, from whence it came;
    My Love's Immortal then, and Mistress too.
