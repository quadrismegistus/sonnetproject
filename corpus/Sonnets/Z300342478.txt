These Eyes (deer Lord) once Brandons of Desire,
Fraile Scoutes betraying what they had to keep,
Which their own heart, then others set on fire,
Their traitorous black before thee here outweep:
These Locks, of blushing deeds the fair attire,
Smooth-frizled Waves, sad Shelfes which shadow deep,
Soule-stinging Serpents in gilded curls which creep,
To touch thy sacred Feete do now aspire.
In Seas of Care behold a sinking Bark,
By winds of sharp Remorse unto thee driven,
O let me not exposed be Ruines mark,
My faults confessed (Lord) say they are forgiven.
    Thus sighed to Iesvs the Bethanian fair,
    His teare-wet Feete still drying with her Hair.
