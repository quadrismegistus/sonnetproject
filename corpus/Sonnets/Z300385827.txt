As does Solsequium lover of the light,
When Sol is absent lock her golden leaves,
And sealed mourns, till it regain his sighed,
Whose flaming rays soon countervails it's griefs.

Far more thy absence me of rest bereaves.
The hoped-Morne the Marigold does cherish:
But when my Sun this blessed horizon leaves,
Hopeless of light my joys in darkness perish.

Stay then my Sun, make this thy Zodiacke,
And move, but make my arms to be the sphere:
Make me thy West, with me thy lodging take,
Moue to my breast, and make thy setting there.

So shall be more glad of thy decline,
Then Ph≈ìbus-floure when he begins to shine.
