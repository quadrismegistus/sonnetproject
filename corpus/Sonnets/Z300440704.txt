Of this fair volume which we World do name
If we the sheets and leaves could turn with care,
Of Him who it corrects, and did it frame,
We clear might read the art and wisdom rare:

Find out His power which wildest powers does tame,
His providence extending everywhere,
His justice which proud rebels does not spare,
In every page, no perjod of the same.

But silly we, Like foolish children, rest
Well pleased with coloured vellum, leaves of gold,
Fair dangling ribbons, leaving what is best,
On the great Writer's sense never taking hold;

Or if by chance we stay our minds on aught,
It is some picture on the margin wrought.
