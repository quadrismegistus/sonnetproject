Tear, scatter, burn, destroy, -- but keep them not;
    I hate, I dread those living witnesses
Of varying self, of good or ill forgotten,
    Of altered Hope's, and withered kindnesses:
    Oh, call not up those shadows of the dead,
Those visions of the passed, that idly blot
    The present with regret for blessings fled:
    This hand that wrote, this ever-teeming head,
This flickering heart is full of chance and change;
    I would not have you watch my weaknesses,
Nor how my foolish likings rome and range,
    Nor how the mushroom friendships of a day
    Hastened in hotbed ripeness to decay,
Nor how to mine own self I grow so strange.
