Through fragrant beechen groves we speed our way;
        Below, the villages from steep to steep
        Crowd round their churches close, Like flocks of sheep
Huddled about their shepherd's in dismay;
The Lombard plain's great level -- blue and gray,
        Through which the coiling rivers gleam and sweep
        Like a sun-smitten, sail-flecked, shadowy deep -- 
Rolls into distance, with a vast inlay
Of towns and towers unnumbered; furthest seen,
    A snowy bar of never-melting cloud,
        Born high on purple wings, the mountains stand,
        And sudden from the peaks of Oberland
To Piedmont's nearest spur of misty green
    Fierce lightnings flash, the thunder peals aloud.
