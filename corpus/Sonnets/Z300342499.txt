Let us each day enure our selves to die,
If this (and not our Feares) be truly Death;
Aboue the Circles both of Hope and Faith
With fair immortal pinions to fly?
If this be Death our best Part to untie
(By ruining the Iaile) from Lust and Wrath,
And every drowsy languor here beneath,
It turning denized Citizen of Skie?
To have, more knowledge than all Bookes contain,
All Pleasures even surmounting wishing Powre,
The fellowship of Gods immortal Train,
And these that Time nor force shall ere devour?
    If this be Death? what Joy, what golden care
    Of Life, can with Deaths ugliness compare?
