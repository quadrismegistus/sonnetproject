Too long, alas! through' Life's tempestuous tide,
    Heedless of Heav'n, my giddy course I steered,
    Link'd with the scoffing crew, nor aught revered
Great Nature's God: such erring dreams belied
My fancy, swollen with unsubstantial pride:
    While, uglier far than have been feigned or feared.
    Ten thousand phantoms to my sighed appeared,
And drew me darkling far from Truth aside:
    But vigorous now, with eagle-ken restored,
By nobler means aiming at nobler ends,
    To the mild bosom of its saving Lord,
Elate with ardent hope, my soul ascends;
    While over the dreadful gulf, yet unexplored,
Religion's golden sun its evening-beam extends.
