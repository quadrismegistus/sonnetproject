TO THE CHILDREN OF THE MUSE
"Nel secol tetro e in questo aer nefando."
None shall put forth a hand and twist the brass
    That galls the neck of Liberty, none dare
    Avert the iron stigma of despair
    And show our eyes how good the battle was.
Yet now for you who, 'mid the blowing grass
    That hides the grave of honour, sit and stare
    In the great muteness of forgotten prayer -- 
    The vengeance of the Lord has come to pass!
They fester in their cities who have scarred
    The face of earth until her skeleton
    Is naked, and her breasts are dry and hard;
Say, shall you tear the world's disheveled robe
