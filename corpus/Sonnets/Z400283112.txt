REMINDING HER OF A PROMISE
Oh, Juliet, we have quarreled with our fate,
And fate has struck us. Wherefore do we cry?
We prayed for liberty, and now too late
Find liberty is this, to say "good-bye."
The Winter which we loved not has gone by,
And Spring is come. The gardens, which were bore
When we first wandered through them, you and I,
The prisoners of our own vain wishes, are
Now full of golden flowers. The very lane
Down to the sea is green. The cactus hedge
We saw cut down has sprouted new again,
And swallows have their nests on the cliff's edge
Where we so often sat and dared complain
