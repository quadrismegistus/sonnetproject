Crusius, I hoped the little Heaven shall spare
    Of my short day, which flits away so fast,
    And sickness threats with clouds to overcast,
In social converse oft with thee to share;

Ill luck for me, that wayward fate should tear
    Thee from the haven, thou hadst gained at last,
    Again to try the toils and dangers passed,
In foreign climates, and and hostile air;

Yet duteous to thy Country's call attend,
    Which clames her portion of thy useful years;
And back with speed thy course to Britain bend:

If, ever again we meet, perchance should end
    My darkening Eve, Thou'lt pay some friendly tears,
Grateful to him, who lived and died thy friend.
