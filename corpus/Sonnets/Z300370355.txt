Once we seemed neighbours; Like two patient ledges               1
or furry citizens of wood and field                                           2
at midnight, when the lunar dawn revealed                              2
savin trees over flowered blueberry hedges                             1
whence our long shadow, from a swollen moon                      3
traversed pastures to herald our approach.                              4

Across night's mound the fading planets wheeled;                            2
thickly the chilly grass was overstrewn                                             3
with strawberries we trampled. Ill concealed                                    2
behind my tongue, all my affection stirred;                                       5
between my lips, only a mocking word                                             5
that dried my palate with pulvery self-reproach.                                4

I feared the heat of light I could not see,                                           6
and silence as sufficient colloquy.                                                     6
