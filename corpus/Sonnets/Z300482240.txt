Thro' changing months a well-attempered mind
    Welcomes their gentle or terrific pace. -- 
    When over retreating Autumn's golden grace
    Tempestuous Winter spreads in every wind
Naked asperity, our musings find
    Grandeur increasing, as the glooms efface
    Variety and glow. -- Each solemn trace
    Exalts the thoughts, from sensual joys refined.
Then blended in our rapt ideas rise
    The vanished charms, that summer-suns reveal,
    With all of desolation, that now lies
Dreary before us; -- teach the soul to feel
    Awe in the present, pleasure in the passed,
    And to see vernal morns in Hope's perspective cast.
