Wilt thou love God, as he thee! then digest,
My Soul, this wholesome meditation,
How God the Spirit, by Angels waited on
In heaven, does make his Temple in thy breast,
The Father having begotten a Son most blessed,
And still begetting, (for he never begun)
Hath deigned to choose thee by adoption,
Coheire to'his glory, 'and Sabbaths endless rest;
And as a robbed man, which by search does find
His stolen stuff sold, must loose or buy'it again:
The Son of glory came down, and was slain,
Us whom he'had made, and Satan stolen, to unbind.
'Twas much, that man was made Like God before,
But, that God should be made Like man, much more.
