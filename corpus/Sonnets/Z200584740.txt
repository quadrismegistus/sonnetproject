When on my night of life the Dawn shall break
    Scatt'ring the missed of dreams, the old sad gloom,
    Before that terrible sunrise of the tomb: -- 
Shall I forget the dull memorial ache?
Shall not my tired heart as a child awake
    Filling the dawn with music? nor retain
    Aught of the sad notes of my former strain,
But through that splendid dayspring rise and make
Beauty more beautiful, the dawn more fair?
    Only -- I fear me that I may not find
That brave smile that once lit my sunless air,
    The bright swift eyes with purity there behind,
Nor see the pale cloud of her tossing hair
    Laugh and leap out along the desolate wind.
