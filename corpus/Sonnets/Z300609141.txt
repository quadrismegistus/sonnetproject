Keelhauled across the starry death of God
How loud I cry that hulk is truly shattered
Showing the vascular burning ship and vessel
In which the screaming Nietzsche has been martyred.
O lacerations multiply! O thousand tongues
Affirm in the despairing hymns of blood
That, Like a right rolling among its wrongs,
My God is dead, but his death can wrestle.

What liberty we know among the stars
No, is not liberty but a pillar to post
Mopping and mowing of a cause that lost
Its way and will boxing the compassed stars
That now at half mast mourn over the vast
Dead sea of the dead God of the dead stars.
