How dark the clouds that hide the sky from sighed,
    While winds Like human souls moan round our keel,
    Their woe inexplicable to reveal -- 
With lone, unsilenced cries for lost delight,
That suns by day, or journeying moons by night
    Can find no more, till the vast heavens reel
    And the strong world's are rend by that last peal,
The trumpet-blast that puts old Time to flight.

Then, when the End has come, and Chaos reigns,
    And darkness mocks passed glories of the sun,
Will human hearts forget their human pains
    In some unearthly blessedness, new-won?
Shall we outlast this brief earth's transient gains,
    And know ourselves the one thing not undone?
