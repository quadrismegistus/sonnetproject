Tongue-doughty Pedant; whose ambitious mind
    Prompts thee beyond thy native pitch to soar;
    And, imped with borrowed plumes of Index-lore,
Range through the Vast of Science unconfined!

Not for Thy wing was such a flight designed:
    Know thy own strength, and wise attempt no more;
    But lowly skim round Error's winding shore,
In quest of Paradox from Sense refined.

Much hast thou written -- more than will be read;
    Then cease from Shakespear thy unhallowed rage;
Nor by a found overweening pride misled,
Hope fame by injuring the sacred Dead:
    Know, who would comment well his godlike page,
Critic, must have a Heart as well as Head.
