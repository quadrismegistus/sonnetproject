Thine Ilbert! is the warmly-feeling heart,
Whence springs the gentle sympathising sighs,
The ingenuous blush unknown to fraudful art,
And tear which glitters in the expressive eye.
Thou wilt require no comment to the strains,
In which (yet not ungraceful) nature reigns.
Connubial happiness was likewise thine;
Ah! why did fate the bound of union tear?
More strongly round thy children therefore twine
Thy arms, and centre every feeling there.
Thee conscious honour guides, pure, virtuous love;
See where each duteous son, each daughter bends!
Who to the kind maternal soul will prove
The truest confidants, the steadiest friends.
