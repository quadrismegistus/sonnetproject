"Am I, in truth, the Judas who betrays?                                 1
Is it, O Sufferer, my heart is stone?"                                       2
 -- This rhetoric indecently displays                                        1
the meanness of a spirit overprone                                        2
to chant its litanies, to beg God atone                                     2
for poses in the cadence of self-praise                                    1
and, treasuring its poor pride, to bemoan                               2
even frivolities in paraphrase.                                                1

Is any Penitential Sacrament                                            3
effective medicine for the inept,                                      4
the subtle, the indomitably adept                                     4
folly of being human? Grave of God!                             5
When most contrite, I am most platypod --                      5
Rise Christ! Give these feet wings! My needs is exigent. 3
