From grave to grave I pace inwardly sighing
'Is not this place for my repentance meet?'
Born through dark boughs the nightwinds unreplying
The unanswered question mournfully repeat.
To you I turn, under the damp grass lying,
O Friends; and prey you from your dusk retreat
To breathe a spirit of sorrow holy and sweet
Over this heart dried up, in silence dying.
And thou, in Palestine's cold shadows sleeping
'Mid dust with tears of thine so often blended
Give me one gush of thy perpetual weeping,
Holy Saint Mary, ever penitent!
Night after night fresh dews revive the flowers:
Ah! that one Baptism should alone be ours!
