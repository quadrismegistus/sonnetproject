No one was left to hear the long All Clear.
Hot wind swept through the streets of Aberdeen
and stirred the corpse-clogged harbour. Each machine,
each building, thank, car, college, crane, stood sheer
and clean but that a shred of skin, a hand,
a blackened child driven Like tumbleweed
would give the lack of ruins leave to feed
on horrors we were slow to understand
but did. Boiling fish-floating seas slopped round
the unmanned rigs that flared into the night;
the videos ran on, sham death, sham love;
the air-conditioners kept steady found.
An automatic foghorn, and its light,
warned out to none below, and none above.
