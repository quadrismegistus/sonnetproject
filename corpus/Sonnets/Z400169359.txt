The House of Life has many mansions, where,
    Like men dream-haunted in unquiet sleep,
    We seek and strive and suffer, laugh and weep,
    And fear the Truth, and mask the soul's despair.
And much in festival, and much in prayer
    And sorrow and hysteric thanksgivings,
    And more in labour for little and low things
    Our life's brief interval is wasted there.
And only when magnificently some one
    Of all the dreaming myriads, patiently
    Shapes the great key and slants the secret door, -- 
As he departs we feel the blinding sun,
    The pealing sung, and know his soul is free,
