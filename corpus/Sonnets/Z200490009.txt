You Fawnes and Siluans, when my Chloris brings
Hir flocks to water in your pleasant plains,
Sollicite his to pity Corins stings,
The smart whereof for his he still sustains.
For she is ruthless of my woeful sung.
My oaten read she not delights to hear.
O Chloris, Chloris, Corine thou dost wrong,
Who loves thee better than his own heart deer.
The flames of Aetna are not half so hight,
As is the fire which thy disdain hath bred.
Ah cruel fates, why do you then besot
Poor Corins soul with love when love is fled.
    Either cause cruel Chloris to relent,
    Or let me die upon the wound she sent.
