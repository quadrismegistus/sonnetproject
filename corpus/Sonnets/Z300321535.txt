Mary is black, and taller than the last
Yet equal in perfection and desire,
To the one's melting snow, and t'other's fire,
As with whose black their fairness is defaced:

She pants as much for love as that' other two,
But she so virtuous is, or else so wise,
That she will win or will not love a prize,
And but upon good terms will never do:

Therefore who her will conquer aught to be
At least as full of love and wit as she,
Or he shall never gain favour at her hands:

Nay, though he have a pretty store of brains,
Shall only have his labour for his pains,
Unless he offer more than she demands.
