As erst, thou comest, sweet harbinger of Spring,
    Singing the sung that fed my boyish ears
    With promised joys, and pastimes without tears!
Whence comest thou thus so blithe? Methinks thy wing
Hither hath born thee from fair Tempe's bowers.
    Welcome thou art as are the sunny days
    Thou with thee bringest; or hymning host that raise
At thy approach their note; while nymphs with flowers
The groves and meadows paint! Welcome, sweet bird,
    Whate'er the spot thou visitest, there glad
    Thou makest the heart; age is no longer sad;
But does forget his years when thou art herd!
    When next thou leavest us, would that I might share
    Thy flight, and with thee to strange climes repair.
