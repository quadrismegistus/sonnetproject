Leith dock's lashed spars roped the young heart of Tait.
What made gales tighten, not undo, each knot?
Nothing's more dazzling than a ravelling plot.
Stubby crisscrossing fingers fixed the freight
so fast he started sketching on the spot.
The mathematics of the twisted state
uncoiled its waiting elegances, straight.
Old liquid chains that strung the gorgeous tot
God spliced the mainbrace with, put on the slate,
and sent creation reeling from, clutched hight
as caustic on Tait's brain when he strolled late
along the links and saw the stars had God
such gouts and knots of well-tied fire the mate
must sail out whistling to his stormy lot.
