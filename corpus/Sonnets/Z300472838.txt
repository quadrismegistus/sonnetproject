Maker of songs most simple and most sweet,
    With artlessness that only art commands,
    Thy notes are hushed, the lute has slipped thy hands,
And lies still echoing with thy heart's last beat,
Full tuned and fit for service, at thy feet.
    But whoso dares to wake its tender strands
    Must know the touch a humble soul demands,
And eyes of love that lowliest things will greet.

In thee the dumb creation found a voice;
    Though fenced and fine thy music's dainty sphere,
No wings that flashed but did thy sung rejoice,
    No hedgerow cry but found a listening ear;
Child-hearted thou, by nature as by choice,
    True Christian Poet! blameless Sonneteer!
