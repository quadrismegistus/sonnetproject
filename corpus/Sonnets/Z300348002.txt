But some do wrestle every inch oh' the way,
For life and death, with Time, and pluck him by
The forelock, his untiring speed to' outvie;
Their hearts before their heads oft turning gray!
And though', if fighting "the good fight" he may
Not quite prevail, yet does he smite their thigh,
Like Jacob's, and to death they then come nigh;
Yet haply "face to face" with him may say,
"I have seen God!" Like him in this from then
Time, ere they let him go, does bless them too,
Blessing beyond all bless and bliss of men!
They shall prevail with God, and under new
And grander name their name come back again,
As Jacob Israel, for they wrestled true!
