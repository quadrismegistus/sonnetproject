Thou, who successive in that honoured seat
    Presid'st, the feuds of jarring Chiefs to 'suage,
    To check the boisterous force of Party rage,
Raise modest worth, and guide the high debate,

Sometimes retiring from the toils of State,
    Thou turnest th'instructive Greek or Roman page,
    Or what our British Bards of later age
In scarce inferior numbers can relate:

Amid this feast of Mind, when Fancy's Child,
    Sweet Shakespear, raps the soul to virtuous deed,
        When Spenser warbling tunes his Doric lays,
Or the first Man from Paradise exiled
    Great Milton sings, can aught my rustic reed
        Presume to found, that may deserve thy praise?
