Alice is tall and upright as a Pine,
White as blanched Almonds, or the falling Snow,
Sweet as are Damask Roses when they blow,
And doubtless fruitful as the swelling Vine.

Ripe to be cut, and ready to be pressed,
Her full cheeked beauty's very well appear,
And a year's fruit she loses every year,
Wanting a man t'improve her to the best.

Full fain she would be husbanded, and yet,
Alass! she cannot a fit Lab'rer get
To cultivate her to her own content:

Fain would she be (God wot) about her task,
And yet (forsooth) she is too proud to ask,
And (which is worse) too modest to consent.
