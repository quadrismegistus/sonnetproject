Yes, loved retreat, those wonted gales I know,
    That shed soft fragrance over my drooping frame,
    Sweet, as of old, when first the youthful flame
    Was kindled in my veins; and now below
I see thy varlous length of landscape glow
    With all it's customed blooms, it's groves the same,
    It's verdant lawns, and towers of antique same,
    And streams that gently murmur as they flow:
Now too the sounds, that used my soul to cheer,
    Thy mingled melodies of hill and plain,
    Melt in faint murmurs on my ravished ear:
But say, will They too bless my eyes again,
    My Friends of yore? if They no more appear,
    Fair as thou art, thy other charms are vain.
