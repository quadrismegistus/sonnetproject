Dame Nature is no less a snob than we                              1
for she discriminates between her friends,                          2
imposing variously for varied ends                                     2
the limits on her wide benignity.                                         1
In her, not our own kindly mother see;                               1
but, rather, a strange hostess, who unbends                        2
upon occasion, occasionally sends                                      2
her invitations, -- "quite informally."                                   1

I do not mean to cast, hereby, reflection                     3
on the Darwinian Theory of Selection;                       3
nor to ridicule the Pathetic Fallacy;                            1
but only to point out the different status,                    4
the obvious, intellectual hiatus                                    4
between snobbism by fresh ponds, and by a sea.        1
