They Fortune much do wrong that call her blind;
And that she knows not how to give her gifts;
That she's unconstant, wavering as the wind,
Which in a minute many corners shifts.

That she delights in nought but turning states,
The misers raising; mighty ones o'rethrowing,
She loves not long, and long she never hates,
At random (as it lights) her gifts bestowing.

If she were blind, some gift I might have God
By chance: if loving chance I had rise higher,
If long to love or hate inclining not
I once had found her friend; but I will free her.

She sees, can give, is constant, long can hate,
Too well I know't, she still hath crossed my state.
