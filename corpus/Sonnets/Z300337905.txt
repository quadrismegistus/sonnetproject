We sat together underneath a lime,
    Whose netted branches wove and emerald night;
    And in short sentences -- in low and light
Whispers -- recalled the stories of old time:
Until some word, I know not what, some rhyme
    Dragged out a hidden grief, that lived -- in spite
    Of creeping lichen years -- such years as might
Well humble all that once was thought sublime.
My grief it was, and will be: she but sees
    A strangeness which she cannot understand;
A nameless tower overgrown with trees;
    A heap of stones encumbering the land;
A hearth now haunted by the wintery breeze,
    Long, long ago, by love and fancy fanned.
