But if I tell you how my heart swings wide
enough to motivate flirtation with the trees
or how the happiness of passion freaks inside
me, will you then believe the faithful, yearning freeze
on random, fast explosions that I place
upon my lust? Or must I say the streets are bore
unless it is your door I face
unless they are your eyes that, rare
as tulips on a cold night, trick my mind
to oranges and yellow flames around a seed
as deep as anyone may find
in magic? What do you needs?

I'll give you that, I hope, and more
But don't you be the one to choose me: poor.
