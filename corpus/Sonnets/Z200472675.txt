Above the waves shine out the milkwhite sands,
High over the sands a headland rock, overgrown
With ivy, wears a castle for its crown,
And gold with soft sea-lichen, Harlech stands.
Sighs of a captive maid, the fierce commands
Of Collwyn, mad with Gwynedd, and the frown
Of Owain Glyndwr struggling for his own,
And Anjou's Margaret wringing anguished hands, -- 
These, Harlech, at thy bidding start from sleep.
But most, when winds are hushed, and tides are low,
From thy round-towered sanctuary steals
A tramp of men, a clash of armed heels,
And by the music's mellow march I know
How, four years long, great David held the keep.
