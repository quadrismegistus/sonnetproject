Her breast is perfumed and profound as sleep]
Her breast is perfumed and profound as sleep;
    Her fervent, mythic face is clear and fair
    And pale as light; through' all her somber hair
    The tragic splendours of the sunset creep.
And now for me her soul and senses keep
    Incessant vigil, and because we share
    The journey she will neither ask nor care
    Whether the ways of love be smooth or steep.
Her eyes that watch for mine are starred and strange
    As though' there lightened on her inward sighed
    New vistas of the soul's unfettered range;
As though' she saw, across the passive night,
    On far horizons of the seas of change,
