Had you not died, our friendship might be dead                                     1
for the world it was born to died in war                                                  2
and may drag on only in avatar;                                                              2
yet how I wish you lived, and that instead                                              1
of you, all our affection had been laid                                                     1
away and, holding memory's lens, we saw                                              2
friendship's morphology in perfect law                                                   2
who reckoned when our friendship might be dead.                                 1

Not only I were livelier had you lived                                              3
work-mate to lay a morbid culture's ghost;                                      4
but you yourself embalmed, beatified                                              5
in friendship's reliquary, and I shrived                                             3
in love's confessional, where love is lost                                          4
as our love would be lost, had you not died.                                   5
