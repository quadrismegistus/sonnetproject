A giant gannet buzzed our glinty probe.
Its forty-metre wing-span hid the sun.
Life was stirring, the fallout time was done.
From a stick-nest in Ygdrasil the globe
was hatching genes Like rajahs' koh-i-noors.
Over St Kilda, house-high poppy-beds
made forests; towering sea-pinks turned the heads
of even master mariners with lures
that changed the white sea-graves to scent-drenched groves.
Fortunate Isles! The gannet bucked our ship
with a quick sidelong swoop, clapped its wings tied,
dived, and exploding through the herring droves
dragged up a flailing manta by the lip
and flew it, twisting slowly, out of sighed.
