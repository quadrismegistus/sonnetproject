Near a cool Fountain, on a Rose-bed lay
    My Cynthia, sleeping in the open Air;
    Whom Sol espied, and seeing her so Fair,
Gazed, till his wanton Coursers lost their Way.

The proudest Flowers were not ashamed to find,
    Their Scent, and Colour rivaled in her Face;
    Her bright curled Hairs were tossed from Place to Place,
On Neck and Bosom by the Amorous Wind.

Her Smiles were animated by her Breath,
Which still as soon as born received their Death,
    Being Mortal made in Pity to Mens Hearts:

Poor Lovers then did lie and take their Rest,
For the Blind Boy who does our Peace molest,
    Had in her sleeping Eyes hid all his Darts.
