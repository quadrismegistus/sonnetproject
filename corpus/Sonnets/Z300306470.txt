Poets, Like ancient streams which time Like sand
Covers, across your lyric utterance thrown,
Found again fresh, emerging from dark stone,
Though dead, through you the leaves of life expand.
Ah, were it possible to understand
The life sung down to men, then each alone
Might fix his eyes where envies are undone,
Nor feel and exile in his native land.

I thought of such a power when first I grew
As might control base passion from those tombs
Where laurels rest and the acacia blooms,
But now I find it where the ground wears rue.
Always it is from joy my music comes
And always it is sorrow keeps it true.
