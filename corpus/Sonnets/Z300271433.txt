When Macedonia rises, when the air
    Shivers at read deeds daily and nightly done
    Beneath the pitying stars, the sorrowing sun,
Though here in England griefless gardens bear
The rose that shines in ardent Summer's hair,
    The lily whose heart is Summer's wooed and wone, -- 
    Praise God that here the bloodless blue streams run!
That here no murdered mute eyes heavenward glare!

Praise God, and humble of soul and watchful be.
    We are not sinless. Let no crime invoke
    Judgment. By breeze-swept beech and whispering oak
And bright pure wavelets of our guardian sea
Think of the strong land's agony if he,
    The Power that saves, through gloom and terror spoke.
