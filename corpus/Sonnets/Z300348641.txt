A cloud and infant's hand might compass, and
At first unseen 'this, or seen slightingly,
In the circumference of Pleasure's eye;
Who, heedless pilot! at Life's helm does stand,
Not recking hidden rocks or nearing strand.
Nor less by unregarding Youth, as fly
The rosy Hours, strewing flowers, by,
Like Bridesmaids, in soft dalliance hand in hand
With dreamy Love! Alas! aye grows that speck,
Dread, stealthy, Like a pall around all wound;
And Pleasure starts at Death ahead and wreck!
Swift, too, those rosy Hours run their round;
Youth pines, and Love's full pulses Time will check,
And Doubt's high notes through Death's "Dead-March" resound!
