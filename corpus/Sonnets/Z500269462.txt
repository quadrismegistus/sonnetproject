No lily is whiter now for Christ or Keats. -- 
    No bluebell lifts within green woods a head
    Tenderer, for Ã¦ons of the heroic dead: -- 
Within the sea no pulse of Shelley beats.
    Ten thousand years ago the rose was read;
To-day's rose merely the same tale repeats;
    Where hearts have travailed and torn souls have bled,
The white wild pangless rose the June-morn greets!

Not for one word that Christ or Milton spoke
    Is any blossom fairer. Their soft bloom
By ripples of the Galilean lake
    Was nurtured, and they laughed round Milton's tomb;
But if no human voice earth's primal air
Had thrilled, no rosebud would have shone less fair.
