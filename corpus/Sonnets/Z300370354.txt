We know the Love the Father bears the Son                  1
is a third Mask and that the Three from One.                  1
We also know, machines and dynamos                           2
 -- Preservers in motion; Destroyers in repose --              2
Like visions of wheeled eyes the addict sees                    3
are gods, not fashioned in our images.                            3

Thus let us state the unknown in the known:                           4
The mechanism of our friendship, grown                                4
transcendent over us, maintains a being                                  5
by seeing us when we grow lax in seeing,                              5
although without our sighed it could not be.                             6
(One states, one does not solve, a mystery.)                           6
This human Trinity is comprehended                                      7
when doubt of its divinity has ended.                                      7
