D'arcy, to thee, whatever of happier vein,
    Smit with the love of Song, my youth essayed,
    This verse devotes from Aston's secret shade,
Where lettered Ease, thy gift, endears the scene.
Here, as the light-winged moments glide serene,
    I weave the bower, around the tufted mead
    In careless flow the simple pathway led,
And strew with many a rose the Shaved green.
So, to deceive my solitary days,
    With rural toils ingenuous arts I blend,
Secure from envy, negligent of praise,
    Yet not unknown to fame, if D'Arcy lend
His wonted smile to dignify my lays,
    The Muse's Patron, but the Poet's Friend.
