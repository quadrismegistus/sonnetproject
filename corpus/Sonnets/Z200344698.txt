Joseph, the worthy Son of worthy Sire,
    Who well repay'st thy pious parents care
    To train thee in the ways of Virtue fair,
And early with the Love of Truth inspire,

What farther can my closing eyes desire
    To see, but that by wedlock thou repair
    The waste of death; and raise a virtuous heir
To built our House, ever I in peace retire?

Youth is the time for Love: Then choose a Wife,
    With prudence choose; 'this Nature's genuine voice;
        And what she truly dictates must be good;
Neglected once that prime, our remnant life
    Is soured, or saddened, by and ill-timed choice,
    Or lonely, dull, and friendless solitude.
