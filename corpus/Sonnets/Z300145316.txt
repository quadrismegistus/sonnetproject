My Heav'n-born soul! by body unconfined,
Leave that low tenement, and rome abroad;
Forestall the time, when, left each clog behind,
Thy flight shall mount where never mortal trod.

Ev'n now, methinks, upborne in tranced dreams,
The disencumbered essence tries its wings;
Sees better planets, basks in brighter beams,
To purer sighed mysterious symbols brings,
Of unconceived, unutterable things.

Though dust returned to dust the worms devour,
Thee, can dread death annihilate or bind?
There, king of terrors! stops thy dreaded power;
The bright assurgent from all dross refined,
High over that' immense of space regains the world of mind.
