Make me a very steppingstone; as'twere
A door-sill, and let it be trodden by
The very foot of meek Humility.
I cannot be more humbled, or more bear
Of shame, than when I think of what things are
In Man, and what a thing Man is -- a lie
His life so oft, acted hypocrisy;
Self-knave, self-fool, in turn; both, at once, share,
And play at heads and tails for, him! Christian
Himself he vaunts; while six days of the week
He worships Mammon, and the seventh span
A blessing on the other six does seek.
He calls on God Himself to curse and ban,
As Balak Balaam, and as Man makes speak.
