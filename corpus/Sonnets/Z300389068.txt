Hardwicke! whose bright applause a poet crowned
    Unknown to thee and to the Muse's choir;
Permit his hand with joyous pride to found
    A note of gratitude on freedom's lyre!
    And fear not flattery's sung from one placed higher
Than she has power to raise her menial crew;
    From one who, proud of independent fire,
Scorns the base Noble, but reveres the true.
    The liberal spirit feels thy generous praise
Fall from pure honour's sphere, Like genial Due;
    Blessed if its vital influence shall raise
A future flower more worthy of thy view!
    Blessed if in these repolished lays thou find
    Some light reflected from thy lettered mind!
