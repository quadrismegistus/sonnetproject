Here, from laborious Art, proud Towns, you rose!
    Here, in and instant, sunk! -- nor aught remains
    Of all you were! -- on the wide, lonely plains
    Not even a stone, that might these words disclose,
"Here stood Catania;" -- or whose surface shows
    That this was Syracuse: -- but louring reigns
    A trackless Desolation. -- Dim domains!
    Pale, mournful strand! how oft, with anxious throes,
Seek I sad relics, which no spot supplies! -- 
    A Silence -- a fixed Horror sears my soul. -- 
    Inexplicable doom of human crimes,
What art thou? -- Ye overwhelmed cities, rise!
    That your terrific skeletons may scowl
    Portentous warning to succeeding times!
