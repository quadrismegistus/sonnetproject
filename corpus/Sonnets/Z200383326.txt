No choice of change can ever change my mind,
    Choiceles my choice the choicest choice alive:
Wonder of women, were she not unkind,
    The pitiless of pity to deprive.
Yet she, the kindest creature of her kind,
    Accuseth me of self ingratitude:
And well she may, sith by good proof I find
    My self had died, had she not helpful stood.
For when my sickness had the upper hand,
    And death began to show his awful face;
She took great pains my pains for to withstand,
    And eased my heart that was in heavy case.
But cruel now she skorneth what it craveth:
Unkind in kindness, murdering while she saveth.
