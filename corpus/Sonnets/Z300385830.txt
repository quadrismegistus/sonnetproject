My love is such as I can never obtain,
Nor can I think which way to ease my pain:
If I concealed, theres no hope of relief,
If I bewrai't, scorn will increase my grief.
Grief hid brings soonest death, there help remains,
Reueal'd life lingers, languishing in pains:
Since my loves hopeless, and without relief,
I scorn her scorn should add unto my grief:
Therefore my thoughts I'll bury as they rise,
And smother in my soul my infant cries:
So hasten death: then if she chance to hear
I died for love of her I held too deer,
And say was pity with her heavenly breath,
That shall requite me well even after death.
