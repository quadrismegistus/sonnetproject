Hope makes the Sea be plowed in furrows white,
That in the end sweet gain may thence arise;
Hope makes the toiling Trades-man take delight
To labour ear' and late with watchful eyes.

Hope makes the Shepherd in the Winter care
To tend his flock, and lodge them from the cold.
Hope makes the Soldier fight, senseless of Fear
'Mongst hight alarms; both watch and ward to hold.

The Sea-man's hope rich merchandise repaies:
The Trades-man's hope is answered with his hire,
Young Lambs and Wooll, the Shepherds charge defrays,
The Soldiers wage is that he does require.

I do for Hope more then all these sustain,
Yet Hope with no reward repaies by pain.
