There is a pride, as of and elder day
    About thee, Englefield! mid way thy steep
    And wood-crowned eminence, where round thee sweep
Green flowery lawns, trees in the fresh array
Of summer, meadows with the close-piled hay
    Studded, blue waters that do seem to creep
    All listlessly for heat, and cots that sleep
I' the sunshine. How thou tower'st above the gay
    And lovely landscape, in the majesty
Of thy old beauty! Even those mansions bright,
    That pretty town, that gothic chapelry
 [Footnote: 1Kb]
With front and pinnacle so rich and light,
    Seem all as toys and costly pageantry
