Their naked, small ambitions are disgusting.                                1
They prize the world's poor business more than peace.                2
They have no virtue but their looks. Encrusting                           1
their speech with filth, they are senilities.                                     2
Waiting for age to make him less uncouth                                   3
he dared condemn, too harshly, their conceit;                              4
and, blaming their inevitable youth,                                             3
condemned himself as well, and owns -- defeat.                           4

That clown, incarcerate beyond release                                2
in the dark, floorless cell of self-distrusting                          1
foregoes remorse, die by austerities                                    2
and suffers Hell, that I may face my feet                              4
from amphitheatred towns of antique ease                           2
towards desert fastnesses whence bruit truth stalks abroad. (3
