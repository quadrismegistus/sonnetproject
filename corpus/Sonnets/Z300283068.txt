He who has once been happy is for aye
    Out of destruction's reach. His fortune then
Holds nothing secret, and Eternity,
    Which is a mystery to other men,
Has Like a woman given him its joy.
    Time is his conquest. Life, if it should fret,
Has paid him tribute. He can bear to die.
    He who has once been happy! When I set
The world before me and survey its range,
    Its mean ambitions, its scant fantasies,
The shreds of pleasure which for lack of change
    Men wrap around them and call happiness,
The poor delights which are the tale and sum
Of the world's courage in its martyrdom;
