Hail to the Sage divine of Milan's plains!
    Whose labours reached the horrors of the Cell,
    Brought Mercy down from Heav'n with Man to dwell,
    And curbed the biting laws, and checked the reins
Of Justice too severe -- and, lo! the chains,
    At thy command, from off the convict fell,
    The Wheel appeared no more, nor Scaffold Bell
    Bade him prepare for more than mortal pains.
Oh! may thy voice pervade the nations round,
    And Monarchs of their Subject's woes remind;
    So shall thy praise over earth and seas resound,
Nor shall thy own Italia boast a name
    To be compared with thine in future fame,
    So loved by all the Good, so dear to Human Kind.
