I looked upon two corpses in one day,
    Two noble corpses, lying by the shore:
    First, one who on his large proportions boar
The stamp of heathen warrior; where he lay,
Harmless and helpless in his disarray,
    The mild autumnal cheer was clouded over
    By uncouth shades which haunt him evermore,
Dark horrors of his harsh rule passed away.
Then a fair lady, barbarously slave:
    O stately pleasantness, untimely cold!
There might one grieve till sad night should enfold
    The appealing from; and gaze, and gaze again,
As though through longing one might yet behold
    The vanished life. Ah, longing all in vain!
