Who hath not seen into her saffron Bed
The Mornings Goddess mildly Her repose,
Or Her of whose pure Bloud first sprang the Rose,
Lull'd in a Slumber by a Myrtle Shade.
Who hath not seen that sleeping White and Red
Makes Phoebe look so pale, which She did close
In that IÃ¶nian Hill, to ease her Woes,
Which only lives by Nectare Kisses fed:
Come but and see my Lady sweetly sleep,
The sighing Rubies of those heavenly Lips,
The Cupid's which Brests golden Apples keep,
Those Eyes which shine in amid of their Ecclipse,
    And He them all shall see (perhaps) and prove
    She waking but persuades, now forceth Love.
