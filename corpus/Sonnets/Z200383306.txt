Striving is passed, ah I must sink and drown,
    And that in sighed of long descried shore:
I cannot send for aid unto the town,
    All help is vain, and I must die therefore.
Then poor distressed caitiff, be resolved
    To leave this earthly dwelling fraught with care:
Cease will thy woes, thy corpse in earth involved,
    Thou diest for her that will no help prepare.
Oh see: my case her self does now behold,
    The casement open is, she seems to speak:
But she is gone: o then I dare be bold,
    And needs must say, she caused my heart to break.
I die before I drown, o heavy case,
It was because I saw my mistress face.
