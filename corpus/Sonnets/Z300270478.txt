When quiet meadows shine beneath the sun
    Of the grand twentieth century: when the raze
    Lifts up towards cloudless heaven a tearless face:
When the far hills we cannot climb are wone,
Strange prospects seen, and deeds undreamed of done:
    Look back, -- look back, -- you dwellers in the land,
    To us who at the century's strong gates stand
But pass them not -- fast falling one by one! -- 

We sang the future, though the passed loomed dread
    Behind us: sang the morning though the night
    Had not yet opened full-fledged wings for flight;
Born in the mid-strife of a century read,
    We sang the advent of a century white: -- 
We sang the living, -- knee-deep in the dead.
