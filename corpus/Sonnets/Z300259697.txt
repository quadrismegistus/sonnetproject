Thou gazest and the picture fades away
    Like visions after sleep. But unto thee
    One thing remains which thou still canst see,
Like midnight meteors when they flash astray.
It is the woven crown of thorns, and lo,
    Behind it, on thy dim and awe-struck sighed
    There rises up a cross of pale sad light
That slowly deepens till its very glow
Reaches thy inmost soul that, kneeling down
    Beneath a sorrow which all speech but mars,
    Sees, as a glory rises in the night,
Through the rough circlet of the thorny crown
    Another issue forth that to the sighed
    Becomes a blinding splendour thick with stars.
