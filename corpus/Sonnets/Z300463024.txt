O'er barren Ground, my Friend, thou takest thy Way,
    Where scarcely blows a solitary Flower;
Not in these Haunts obscure the Muses stray,
    Nor here hath Fancy raised her Myrtle Bower.
Yet should Encouragement with gentle Voice
    Bid thee amid the desert Rocks proceed,
Should liberal Candour sanctify thy Choice,
    And mark each Step, her Smile the promised Meed,
Thou wilt not shrink; for Genius early taught
    To stoop beneath chaste Reason's Sway austere,
The undissipated Soul with Learning fraught,
    Can change their Subject; firmly persevere;
And scorning Obstacles a Victory gain
    Where labouring Dulness still would plod in vain.
