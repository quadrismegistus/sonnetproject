Dear Babe, whose meaning by found looks expressed,
    Thy only little eloquence, might move
    The sternest soul to tenderness and love,
While thus, nor taught by age to fawn, nor dressed
In Treachery's mask, nor Falsehood's glittering vest,
    Thou sweetly smilest: at the pleasing sighed,
    Wretch as I am, unwonted to delight,
A transient gleam of gladness cheers my breast:
    Yet soon again bursts forth unbidden tear,
And inly bleeds my heart, while I divine
    What chilling blasts may nip thy riper year,
What blackening storms may cloud thy life's decline;
    What for myself I feel, for thee I fear:
Nay! God forbid my woes should ever be thine!
