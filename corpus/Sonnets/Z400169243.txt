I am the world's imperishable desire]
I am the world's imperishable desire;
    Life is because I will, for hope of me
    Life is, nor all the dark depths of the sea
    Could quench mine eyes' light nor my body's fire.
Fresh hyacinth and the violent rose suspire,
    The black clod breaks to green eternally,
    Sap thrills to parturition the naked tree, -- 
    Of all things living I only cannot tire.
I am the world's interminable sin;
    Yea! In my power and lust beyond control,
    Things mortal wage the war of life and win.
For me the slave defies the master's rod,
And while the antique pride swells within his soul
