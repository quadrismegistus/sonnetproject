Mourne not (fair Grece) the ruin of thy kings,
Thy temples razed, thy forts with flames devoured,
Thy champions slain, thy virgins pure deflowered,
Nor all those griefs which stern Bellona brings:
But murne (fair Grece) mourn that that sacred band
Which made thee once so famous by their songs,
Forct by outrageous fate, have left thy land,
And left thee scarce a voice to plain thy wrongs;
Murne that those climates which to thee appear
Beyond both Ph&ocedil;bus and his sisteres ways,
To save thy deeds from death must lend thee lays,
And such as from Museus thou didst hear;
    For now Irene hath attained such fame,
    That Heros Ghost does weep to hear her name.
