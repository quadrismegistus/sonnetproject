Then, let me thank you; let my heart outpour
        In humbleness its earnest gratitude
        To all whose yearnings follow me with good,
Loving my mind and all its simple store:
        O generous friends! -- a cordial multitude
Hived in the West, upon that busy shore
    Where fair Columbia, Britain's child, is throned
    Imperial, yet with empire all unowned, -- 
O generous friends! -- another cordial band
        From far Australia to the Arctic Seas,
And crowds around me in mine own dear land,
        What thanks to pay for mercies great as these? -- 
    Felt from the heart, and by the tongue confessed,
    Be the deep love of one so nobly blessed!
