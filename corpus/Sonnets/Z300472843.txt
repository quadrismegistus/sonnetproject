Kaiser, and crowned with ninety summer's now,
    If every stream that babbled to the Rhine
    Spake human speech, today its praise were thine.
Ageless of heart and zeal -- oak-natured thou,
Come forth and let the wondering nations know
    How kings may still be kings by power divine,
    How monarch's might can people's right enshrine,
And patriot love to royal wisdom bow.

Great worker with the tireless brain and hand,
    Head winter-white -- Soul Spring with fullest powers,
        Unhurt by praise and never warped by blame,
        Heaven waits thee, King, but Earth shall keep thy name,
    Ours now, when God shall call thee hence still ours,
By all that made and keeps us Fatherland.
