O Father-God who by thy word didst make
The Azurd-vault, and all the host of heaven,
The hills, vales, plains, fresh streams, & briny lake,
And unto each inhabitants hast given:

O Word which (for our sakes) didst flesh become,
With sinners to purge sin hadst habitation:
Crimeles accused, condemned, the cross thy doom,
Suffredst Death, Buriall, rose for our salvation.

O Holy Ghost which dost from both proceed,
Sweet soule-inspiring-spirit with peace and love:
Comfort to all, cast down for sinful deed,
Lessening their woes with hoys of Heaven above.

O Triuall-one, one God and Persons three,
Reforme my ways, and draw me unto Thee.
