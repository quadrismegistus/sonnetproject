The isles of Scotland! the isles of Scotland!
But Byron sang elsewhere; loved, died elsewhere.
Seferis stiffly cupped warm blue May air
and slowly sifted it from hand to hand.
It was good and Greek. Amazed to find it,
he thought the dancing sea, the larks, the boats
spoke out as clear as from Aegean throats.
What else there was -- he might half-unwind it.
One day he visited the silent cave
where Walter Scott, that tawdry Ulysses,
purloined a suffocated clansman's skull.
Crowns of Scottish kings were sacred; the lave
can whistle for dignity -- who misses
them, peasants, slaves? Greeks, too, could shrug the cull.
