When Recollection stirs up in the mind
    And sets before her eye passed scenes of woe,
In vain will the wise men their sayings bring
    Dead, unimpassioned, wrote in the full flow
Of health and strength, to nicer feelings blind:
    In vain against Reflection's piercing sting,
They urge a formal phrase, or adage quaint,
    And with a shrewd and well-turned point of wit,
Or a laborious studied argument,
    Think to chase far away the fretful fit:
They might as well drink the wide ocean dry,
    Or rob cold Winter of his snowy beard:
Spite of the vain saws of Philosophy,
    Nature is prevalent, and will be herd.
