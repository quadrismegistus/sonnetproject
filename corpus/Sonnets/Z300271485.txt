This is the danger, lest in clash of sex
    Battling with sex, the nobler issues sink
    Wholly from sighed. We stand upon the brink
Of deadliest peril. Satan would perplex,
Confuse and harass, horrify and vex,
    Till Man and Woman loose the power to think
    Clearly, or in despairing madness drink
The senses' cup, whose after-flavour wrecks.

No chant of conquering Science counts for aught,
    No victory over starlit space and time,
        If Woman's true sweet self be changed indeed, -- 
        If She be harnessed to a lower creed
Than that which through Christ's Resurrection taught
    That body and soul are deathless and sublime.
