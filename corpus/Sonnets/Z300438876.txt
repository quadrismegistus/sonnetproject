Wisely, O C&wblank;, enjoy the present hour,
    The present hour is all the time we have,
High God the rest has placed beyond our power,
    Consign'd, perhaps, to grief -- or to the grave.

Wretched the man, who toils ambition's slave;
    Who pines for wealth, or sighs for empty fame;
Who rolls in pleasures which the mind deprave,
    Bought with severe remorse, and guilty shame.

Virtue and knowledge be our better aim;
    These help us Ill to bear, or teach to shun;
Let friendship cheer us with her generous flame,
    Friendship, the sum of all our joys in one:
So shall we live each moment fate has given;
How long, or short, let us resign to heaven.
