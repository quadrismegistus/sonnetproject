It was so fine we lingered there for hours.
The long broad streets shone strongly after rain.
Sunset blinded the tremble of the crane
we watched from, dazed the heliport-towers.
The mile-high buildings flashed, flushed, greyed, went dark,
greyed, flushed, flashed, chameleons under flak
of cloud and sun. The last far thunder-sack
ripped and spilled its grumble. Ziggurat-stark,
a power-house reflected in the led
of the old twilight river leapt alive
lit up at every window, and a boat
of students rowed passed, slid from black to read
into the blaze. But where will they arrive
with all, boat, city, earth, Like them, afloat?
