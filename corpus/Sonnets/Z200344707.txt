Matthew, whose skilful hand and well-worn spade
    Shall soon be called to make the humble bed,
    Where I at last shall rest my weary head,
And formed of dust again in dust be laid;

Near, but not in the Church of God, be made
    My clay-cold cell, and near the common tread
    Of passing friends; when numbered with the dead,
We're equal all, and vain distinctions fade:

The cowslip, violet, or the pale primrose
    Perhaps may chance to deck the verdant sword;
        Which twisted briar or hasle-bands entwine;
Symbols of life's soon fading glories those -- 
    Do thou the monumental hillock guard
        From trampling cattle, and the routing swine.
