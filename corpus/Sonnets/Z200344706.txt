My gracious God, whose kind conducting hand
    Has steered me through this Life's tumultuous sea,
    From many a rock, and many a tempest free,
Which prudence could not shun, nor strength withstand,

And brought at length almost in sighed of land,
    That quiet haven where I long to be,
    Only the straights of Death betwixt, which we
Are doomed to pass, ever reach the heavenly strand;

Be this short passage boisterous, rough, and rude,
    Or smooth, and calm -- Father, thy Will be done -- 
        Support me only in the troublous stour;
My sins all pardoned through my Saviour's blood,
    Let Faith, and Hope, and Patience still hold on
        Unshaken, and Joy crown my latest hour!
