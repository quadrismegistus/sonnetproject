O sacred Love of Country! purest flame,
    That wont in Britons' honest hearts to blaze,
    And fire them to achieve high deeds of praise,
Which earn the guerdon of eternal fame;

If aught of thee remain, beside the name
    And semblance vain, to these degenerate days;
    With all the effulgence of thy heavenly rays
Shine forth, and dash the spurious Patriot's claim;

That bold bade man, who bellowing in the cause
    Of truth and virtue, and with fraudful skill
        Winning the giddy changing multitude,
Warps on the wind of popular applause
    To private wealth and power; pretending still
        With hard unblushing front the public good.
