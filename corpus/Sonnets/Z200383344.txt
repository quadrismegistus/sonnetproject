Most true that I must fair Fidessa love,
Most true that fair Fidessa cannot love.
Most true that I do feel the pains of love,
Most true that I am captive unto love.
Most true that I deluded am with love,
Most true that I do find the sleights of love.
Most true that nothing can procure her love,
Most true that I must perish in my love.
Most true that she contemnes the God of love,
Most true that he is snared with her love.
Most true that she would have me cease to love,
Most true that she her self alone is Love.
Most true that though she hated I would love,
Most true that dearest life shall end with love.
