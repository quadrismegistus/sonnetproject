In all the Greek None but this word is found,
That does contain a true description,
Of virtues Cardinall, which done abound
In thine Heroical disposition.
Agape shows thy composition:
Love it is called in our Dialect,
Eros is Venerie; but this Dilection,
Chaste, holy, modest, divine and perfect,
Arcadian Sydney gave thee this aspect,
When he forsook this transitory Globe,
To mount the whirling Orbs with course direct,
Adorning thee with love for marriage Robe.
    Sith famous Wroth Agape hath possessed:
    Ourania pray's a while to be your guest.
