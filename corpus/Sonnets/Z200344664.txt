Wisely, O Clerk, enjoy the present hour,
    "The present hour is all the time we have,"
High God the rest has placed beyond our power,
    Consign'd perhaps to grief -- or to the grave.

Wretched the man, who toils ambition's slave;
    Who pines for wealth, or sighs for empty fame;
Who rolls in pleasures, which the mind deprave,
    Bought with severe remorse, and guilty shame.

Virtue and Knowledge be our better aim;
    These help us Ill to bear, or teach to shun;
Let Friendship cheer us with her generous flame,
    Friendship, the sum of all our joys in one:
So shall we live each moment fate has given,
How long or short, let us resign to Heaven.
