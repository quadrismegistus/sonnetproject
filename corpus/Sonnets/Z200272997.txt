Fortune, hates not, them that hate her:
Fortune, loves not, them that love her:
Fortune, would, and cannot rate her:
Fortune, shall, and must remove her.
    And though fickle Fortune smile:
    It is but for a little while.

Green loud Fortune foolish Man,
Foolish man, why loud he so?
And her foolish raze he ran,
Foolish raze thats run with we.
    Who then (Alas) was less misused?
    Now (Alas) is more abused?

But let Fowles and foolish fellows,
Bark and bite their belly fill:
