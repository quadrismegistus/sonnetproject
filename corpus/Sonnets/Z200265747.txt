Loe how the Sailer in a stormy night
Wailes and complains, till he the star perceive
Whose situation and assured hight
Should guide him through the strong and watery Cave.
As many motives, wretched soul, I have
For to regrat, as few for to rejoice
In seeing all things, once this sighed I crave,
Since I the Loadstare of my life did lose.
And which is worse, amids those many woes,
Amidds my pains which passes all compare,
Noe help, no hope, no comfort, no repose
Noe sun's appears to clear those clouds of care,
    Save this, that fortune neither may nor dare
    Make my mishaps more hapless then they are.
