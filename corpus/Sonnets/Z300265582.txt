Since, Cruel Thyrsis, you my Torments slight,
    And take no notice of my Amorous Flame,
In these Vermilion Letters thus I write
    My bloody Reasons to confirm the same.

These of my Passion are the lively Marks,
    Which from my Veins you here in Blood see writ,
Touch them, your Breast will kindle with the Sparks,
    The ardent Characters are reeking yet.

Nor can my Pen alone my Heart explain,
My very Soul overcharged with grief, I fain
    Would send enclosed herein, the truth to prove.
And if I've been too sparing of my Blood,
This is the Reason why I stopped the Flood,
    I would not spoil the Face I'ld have you love.
