'Tis May! -- once more the laughing meads rejoice,
    Once more the salutary zephyrs play,
Once more the grove's gay tenants tune their voice
    To hail the lustre of the vernal day!

The quivering wave in gay meander flows,
    The silken insect skims the silver stream,
The azure violet, and the pale primrose,
    On every green bank negligently gleam.

Brighter the lustre of the glowing skies,
    And brighter still as noontide hours advance,
The painted landscape beams with deeper die,
    And rays more potent through' light Ã¦ther glance.
But what, alas! avails the jocund day
To uniform distress, 'this never -- May!
