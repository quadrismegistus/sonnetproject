This Morn ere yet had rung the matin peal,
    The cursed Merlin, with his potent spell,
    Aggriev'd me soar, and from his vizard cell,
    (First fixing on mine eyes a magic seal)
Millions of ghosts and shadowy shapes let steal;
    Who, swarming round my couch, with horrid yell,
    Chatter'd and moe'd, as though from deepest Hell
    They had escaped. -- I oft, with fervent zeal,
Essay'd, and prayer, to mar that' Enchanter's Pow'r.
    In vain; for thicker still the crew came on,
    And now had weighed me down, but that the Day
Appear'd, and Phebus, from his Eastern Tower,
    With new-trick'd beam, Like Truth immortal, shone,
    And chaced the visionary forms away.
