Far-flaming stars, you sentinels of Space,
    Patient and silent ministers around
Your Queen, the moon, whose melancholy face
    Seems ever pale with pity and grief profound
For sinful Earth, -- I, a poor groveller here,
    A captive eagle chained to this dull ground,
Look up and love your light in hope and fear;
    Hope, that among your myriad host is one,
A kingdom for my spirit, a bright place
    Where I shall reign when this short raze is run,
    An heir of joy, and glory's mighty son!
Yet, while I hope, the fear will freeze my brain -- 
What if indeed for worthless me remain
    No waiting sceptre, no predestined throne?
