Father, part of his double interest
Unto thy kingdom, thy Son gives to me,
His jointure in the knotty Trinitie,
He keeps, and gives to me his death's conquest.
This Lamb, whose death, with life the world hath blessed,
Was from the world's beginning slain, and he
Hath made two Wills, which with the Legacie
Of his and thy kingdom, do thy Sons invest,
Yet such are these laws, that men argue yet
Whether a man those statutes can fulfil;
None does, but thy all-healing grace and Spirit,
Revive again what law and letter kill,
Thy laws abridgement, and thy last command
Is all but love; Oh let this last Will stand!
