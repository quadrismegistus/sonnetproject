"Tears in the eyes and on the lips a sighs!"
    Haydon! the great, the beautiful, the bold,
    Thy wisdom's king, thy mercy's God unfold,
There art and genius blend in union high.
But this is of the soul. The majesty
    Of grief is here, grief cast in such a mould
    As Niobe of yore. The tale is told
All at a glance -- A childless mother I!
    The tale is told: -- but who can ever forget
That ever hath seen that visage of despair!
    With unaccustomed tears our cheeks are wet;
Heavy our hearts with unaccounted care;
    Upon our thoughts it presses Like a debt;
We close our eyes in vain -- that face is there!
