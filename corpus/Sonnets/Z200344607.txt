My thoughts ascending the High house of fame,
    Found in records of virtuous monuments
A map of honours in a noble frame,
    Shining in spite of death's oft banishments:
A thousand colours Love sat suited in,
    Guarded with honour and immortal time,
Lust led with envy, fear, and deadly sin,
    Opposde against fair Loves outliving line.
True Constancy kneeled at the feet of Love,
    And begged for service, but could not procure it:
Which seen, my heart stepped forth & thought to move
    Kind Love for favour, but did not allure it:
Yet when my heart swore Constancy was true,
Love welcomed it, and gave them both their due.
