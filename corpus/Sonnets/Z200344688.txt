The Beechen Roots of wood-clad Buckingham
    To Bedford Elms, their courteous brethren, send
    Health and kind greeting, as from friend to friend,
And gladly join to celebrate their fame;

Beyond all roots above ground we proclaim
    You happiest, destined all your days to spend
    In Wrests fair groves, and Graia to defend
From Eurus' blasts, and Ph≈ìbus sultry flame;

High Privilege to you, though dead, accorded,
    Which every living tree with envy views!
        We envy not, but prey for your stability;
Proud, that ourselves by Graia are regarded,
    At her command we not the fire refuse,
        But cheerful blaze and burn with [Footnote: 1Kb] Affability
