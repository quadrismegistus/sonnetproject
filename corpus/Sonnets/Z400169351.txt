When she returns to me, when there is found]
When she returns to me, when there is found
    And motion of her, and perfume of her,
    And light and laughter of her eyes that were
    The stars whither my homeless life was bound, -- 
When she returns and all my days resound
    With Love's clear voice, who is her chorister,
    And all my heart is shaken with the stir
    Of Love's wide wings, and all my life is crowned
With her and her delight and her desire,
    And all the night long, strong and swift as fire,
    Her deep caress responds to my embrace, -- 
When she returns what shall I offer thee,
    Upon thine altars in thy dwelling-place,
