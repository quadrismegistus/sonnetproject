A robin came before the spring was ready.
A tulip burst before the frost was gone.
A star burned on, complacent, and as steady
As if it were not ages passed the dawn.
A leaf showed brown before the turn of autumn.
A head showed white before its days were up.
A clear reflection showed across the bottom
Before the milk had vanished from the cup.
What matters that I came before the morn?
What matters if I go before the spring?
I had a perfect flight, where stars are born,
Across the void from sleep to wakening.
The tulip and the bird, the star and I
Have had our perfect taste of sun and sky.
