Grim dawned the day beneath a blood-red bar,
    Grey comes the noon, and over fell and flood
    A sense of desolation seems to brood
Sorrow and loss; with echoes from afar
The clouds upon Helvellyn smoke of war,
    The moorland welters purple-dark with blood,
    While all the world looks on in wistful mood
Where fierce Mikado shocks with mighty Tsar.

This is a day of battles! since Sedan
    The thunder of this day has never died,
        The crash of empire has not passed away;
    Lord God of battles, when shall lust and pride
        Cease, and beneath Love's universal sway
The Nations rest confederate man with man?
