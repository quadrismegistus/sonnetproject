C&wblank;e, with whom, my pilot and my guide,
    Pleas'd I have traversed thy Sabrina's flood,
    Both where she foams impetuous soiled with mud,
And where she peaceful rolls her golden tide.

Never, O never let ambition's pride
    (Too oft pretexted with our country's good)
    And tinseled pomp, despised when understood,
Or thirst of wealth thee from her banks divide.

Reflect how calmly, Like her infant wave,
    Flows the clear current of a private life;
        See the wide public stream by tempests tossed,
Of every changing wind the sport, or slave,
    Soil'd with corruption, vexed with party strife,
        Cover'd with wrecks of peace and honour lost.
