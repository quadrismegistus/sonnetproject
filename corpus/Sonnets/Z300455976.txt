Cowper! who now in Weston's favoured shades
    Serenely seated, dost with vision clear
    Scan old Ilissus' haunts, and to the maids
    Of Phœbus' train, thy name for aye endear
By classic sung. Ah, rather let our ear
    Catch the high rapture of that holier strain,
    Which Israel's prophet had rejoiced to hear
    On Horeb's sacred mount, or Salem's plain.
Energic Sage! thy pious "Task" resume,
    Let Homer's verse no longer thine suspend;
    With heavenly ray our terrene path illume,
Bid Christian with Mæonian ardours blend;
    So round thy laurels still shall palms entwine,
    And future ages hail thee -- Bard Divine!
