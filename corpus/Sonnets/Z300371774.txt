it is better to receive
the friend says
oddly      surely       certainly
they drum the poem back
into the earth
of california        the poem
remembered by its silences
the words drop out
empty & useless
the car barrels down the freeway
eating the last
french fried potato                            for Emmett Williams
old scraps of satisfaction
from a friend
