How falls the evening on Varese's plain
        When over Monte Rosa day declines! -- 
        A cool air whispers in among the vines;
The swifts cry loud, and from her grove again
The nightingale retells her love and pain;
        White lies the lake, stand purple-dark the pines;
        Unseen before to sudden brightness shines
Now town, now tower, Like lilies after rain.

Then populous cities tremble into haze,
    The silver roads gleam out and fade afar,
        The lucent mists go wandering out of sighed,
    Till, though Bisbino show his silver star,
Our sacred mountain's shadow as we gaze
        Grows, and Val Gagna darkens into night.
