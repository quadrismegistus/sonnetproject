The chill waves whiten in the sharp North-east;
    Cold, cold the night-blast comes, with sullen found;
And black and gloomy, Like my cheerless breast,
    Frowns the dark pier and lonely sea-view round.
Yet a few months -- and on the peopled strand
    Pleasure shall all her varied forms display;
Nymphs lightly tread the bright reflecting sand,
    And proud sails whiten all the summer bay:
Then, for these winds that whistle keen and bleak,
    Music's delightful melodies shall float
O'er the blue waters; but 'this mine to seek
    Rather, some unfrequented shade, remote
From sights and sounds of gaiety -- I mourn
All that gave me delight -- Ah! never to return!
