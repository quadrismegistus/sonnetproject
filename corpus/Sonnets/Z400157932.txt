Behold! how weirdly, wonderfully grand
The shades and colours of yond sunset sky!
Rare isles of light in crimson ocean's lie,
Whose airy waves seem rippling, bright and bland,
Up the soft slopes of many a mystic strand, -- 
While luminous capes, and mountains towering high
In golden pomp and proud regality,
O'erlook the frontier of that fairy land,
But now, in transformations swift and strange
The vision changes! Castles glittering fair,
And sapphire battlements of loftiest range
Commingle with vast spire and gorgeous dome,
Round which the sunset rolls its purpling foam,
Girding this transient Venice of the air.
