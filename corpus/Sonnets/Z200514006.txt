Apostates, not apostles! you shall hear
    Thro' my weak tongue indignant England's voice;
    At you her patriots groan, her foes rejoice,
For you sad Zion drops the bitter tear:
Alas! our prophets fail, our princes fear,
        The wise men stumble, and the seers are blind,
    And you, our sacred guardians, are of those
        Who, placed in power on earth to lose and bind,
Seem weak as doves truth's tottering cause to aid,
    And shrewd as serpents to befriend her foes:
        Fear, for yourselves; for, if no ravening Rome,
On whom you dote so tenderly afraid,
Shall rend the shepherd's who their trust betrayed,
        Your very sheep shall find you fears at home.
