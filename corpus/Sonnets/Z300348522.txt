Oh, when I gaze on that transcendent sighed,
Whose beauty ravishes and grandeur awes,
Whose mystery confounds in end and cause,
Between which, as between that' opposèd might
Of that' upper and neither millstones, Self is quite
To atoms ground; my petty life does pause,
And, as constrainèd by a Power which draws
Mysteriously, in Being's Whole takes flight!
Yes! gently, yet resistlessly as stream
(With ocean meeting) merges in the tide,
I loose my "Self:" recalled from that grand dream,
I think on graves, and all that we would hide:
I crawl again; and basest creatures seem
To trail with slime of Earth over all Man's pride!
