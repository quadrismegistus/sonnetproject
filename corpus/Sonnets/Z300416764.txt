If, as the mystics say, grace from above
    More frequent dawns while tears of anguish roll,
    Wrestling with passion of the fallen soul,
There might be consolation thus to prove
An inward torment; thus, Like Noah's dove,
    To know no restingplace from grief's control;
    No sheltered spot where memory does not toll
The knell of sorrow for some severed love.
But if and idle anguish desecrate
    From every pure and intellectual aim,
        The abided of thought, the temple of the mind,
What but despair and blasphemy await? -- 
    Religion, come, in Patience' holy name,
        The self-abandoned heart thou'rt pledged to bind. [Footnote: 1Kb]
