There is the warmth of flesh: there is the air:
Sky: and the things of earth: there are the things
Partly of earth, Like meadowlarks and rare
Designs of cobweb where the bright Due clings.
There is the body's glide into a deep
Lake where the water closes cool and green:
Patterns of words Like music herd in sleep:
Singing: the fall of stars, seen, half-unseen.

Strange that a man should know these these things and still
Be lost in the mind's vortex, in the blowing
Storm of the soul: strange that they should not fill
The mind and heart with peace beyond all knowing:
That having these a man should stand and cry
His agony to the world's midnight sky.
