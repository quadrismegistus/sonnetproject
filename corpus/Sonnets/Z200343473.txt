Temples he built and palaces of air,
    And, with the artist's parent-pride aglow,
    His fancy saw his vague ideals grow
Into creations marvellously fair;
He set his foot upon Fame's neither stair.
    But ah, his dream, -- it had entranced him so
    He could not move. He could no farther go;
But paused in joy that he was even there!

He did not wake until one day there gleamed
    Thro' his dark consciousness a light that racked
His being till he rose, alert to act.
But lo! what he had dreamed, the while he dreamed,
    Another, wedding action unto thought,
    Into the living, pulsing world had brought.
