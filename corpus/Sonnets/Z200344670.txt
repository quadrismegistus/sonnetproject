Woe worth the man, who in ill hour assayed
    To tempt that Western Frith with venturous keel;
    And seek what Heav'n, regardful of our weal,
Had hid in fogs, and night's eternal shade;

Ill-starr'd Hibernia! well art thou apaid
    For all the woes, which Britain made thee feel
    By Henry's wrath, and Pembroke's conquering steel;
Who sacked thy Towns, and Castles disarrayed:

No longer now with idle sorrow mourn
    Thy plundered wealth, or liberties restrained,
        Nor deem their victories thy loss or shame;
Severe revenge on Britain in thy turn,
    And ample spoils thy treacherous waves obtained,
        Which sunk one half of Spenser's deathless fame.
