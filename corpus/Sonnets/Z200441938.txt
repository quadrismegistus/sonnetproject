There was a time, when England, fresh and strong,
And Like a tree, forth to the summer air
Would spread her beauteous leaves and blossoms fair:
Then each man followed that which did belong
To his own boundary; nor fraud, nor wrong
Was witnessed, still demanding fresh repair:
Seamen the battle, churchmen at their prayer
Were seen; and soldiers loyed the trumpet's sung. -- 
All now is altered! -- Senators the gown
Cast off, that wisdom we may better learn
From babes and sucklings; -- beardless youths pull down
Laws that were framed by brains, both strong and stern;
And all from far and near, from bower and town,
For place, and gain, and venal title burn.
