It is some comfort to the wronged man,
    The wronger of injustice to upbraid:
Justly my self herein I comfort can,
    And justly call her and ungrateful maid.
Thus am I pleased to rid my self of crime,
    And stop the mouth of all-reporting fame:
Counting my greatest cross the lose of time,
    And all my private grief her public shame.
Ah (but to speak a truth) hence are my cares,
    And in this comfort all discomfort rests:
My harms I cause (her scandal) unawares,
    Thus love procures the thing that love detesteth.
For he that views the glasses of my smart,
Must needs report she hath a flinty heart.
