In cities warped, behind so many screens,
So many blinds drawn down on light direct,
So much between the first cause and the effect;
Age premature and Youth without its teens;
False tastes, perverted appetites, ill spleens,
Whims, humours, likes, dislikes, dainty respect
And overnice regard, we scarce detect
Great Nature when we meet, or what she means
Rightly interpret. So much comes between
Eye, ear, taste, touch (sophisticated all),
And her wise teaching; so well does Art wean,
Her mother milk tastes now scarce natural.
Our life must be dressed up Like a stage-scene,
And Nature, drugged, into hysterics fall.
