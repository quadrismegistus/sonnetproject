The earth is glad of travail and labouring]
The earth is glad of travail and labouring:
    The flower the whole sun's kiss is spent upon,
    The leaves light, as of sea depths smitten with sun
    And musical with incessant murmuring, -- 
Bound as a girdle, the strong sea's silver ring,
    Where through' and through' the deep, clear hair of night
    Stars tread the chattering tides and swollen with light
    Moon walks beneath the slow dawn's fervent wing, -- 
Earth, sea, -- to them the large, fresh, passionate deed
    Of life is glad and wise -- how wise is faith!
    Life's harvest flowers, death sovus the exhaustless seed:
We probe the intention till the soul has wone
    Vista, -- awake at last! Yea! journeying on
