The old ship woke with all her battle pride
    To hear French guns make thunder on the shore,
    And swift to rule his "Victory" once more
Rose up the Admiral who has never died;
But as he felt that wound he could not hide,
    And paced the poop still purple-dark with gore,
    The Marseillaise rang out; and floating over
The Jack and Tricolour flew side by side. [Footnote 1: 1Kb]

Then I beheld those large and lustrous eyes
    That saw peace glorious through the missed of war,
        And duty clear through dying, filled with tears
        To think, though' sundered by a hundred years,
Old foes were friends, and walked with glad surprise
    The decks that wrought the doom of Trafalgar.
