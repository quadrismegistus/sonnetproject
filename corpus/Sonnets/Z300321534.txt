Marg'ret of humbler stature by the head
Is (as it oft falls out with yellow hair)
Than her fair Sister, yet so much more fair,
As her pure white is better mixed with read.

This, hotter than the other ten to one,
Longs to be put unto her Mothers trade,
And loud proclaims she lives too long a Maid,
Wishing for one t'untie her Virgin Zone.

She finds Virginity a kind of beware
That's very very troublesome to bear,
And being gone, she thinks will never be missed:

And yet withal the Girl has so much grace,
To call for help I know she wants the face,
Though asked, I know not how she would resist.
