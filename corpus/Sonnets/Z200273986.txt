Oh! who at sleepless nights and toilsome days,
    To duty consecrate, would ever repine?
    Though outward strength may day by day decline,
And night by night the taper's glimmering rays
Illume a cheek whose healthful bloom decays:
    What boots it? if, from its internal shrine,
    The wakeful spirit hear a voice divine
Whisper approval passing mortal praise.
    Milton! 'it worthy greatness Like thine own
        To lend to such high oracle thine ear;
        Relinquishing the light of day, though dear,
    For that which in thy soul yet brighter shone,
    And, glorying in infirmities alone,
        To prove how perfect love can cast out fear.
