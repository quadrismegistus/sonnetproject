Cut lose! Hoist sail! Leave the familiar shores]
Cut lose! Hoist sail! Leave the familiar shores
    Of life! Drive out on love's enormous wind
    Far from the safe small pieties and blind
    Tangles of conscience! O set wide the doors
And throw the strong arms open utterly!
    Go forth reckless with faith and unresigned,
    Thus only seeking shall you surely find
    The peril and rapture of true liberty!
Thus only shall divine discoveries
    Stretch the vague margins of the conscious soul
    And fire the peaks of more inclusive skies;
Thus may we burst the self-created bound
    Of sordid fears and hear life's surges roll
