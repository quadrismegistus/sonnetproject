I love to see them, serri√®d file on file,
Truth's meteor "oriflamme" above their head,
The glorious host of Living and of Dead:
Living, who cannot die; Dead, who the while
Yet speak, and dead and living reconcile.
Thought's noble army of martyrs, who have led
Men's minds, not bodies; and whose "Word" once said,
Shines Like the stars, and inextinguishable!
A humble volunteer, in awe I seek
Companionship, as who the Red Cross boar,
Crusaders these, whose good swords cannot break,
Ithuriel-spears, that pierce to Falsehood's core.
A mighty shout comes down the ages: streak
On streak foretells the dawn, the night is over!
