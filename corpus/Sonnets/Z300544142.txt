When I with trembling ask if you love still,
    My soul afflicted lest I give offence,
    Though sensibly discerning my worst ill;
    Yet rather then offend, with grief dispense.

Faintly you say you must; poor recompense
    When grateful love is force, I see the hill
    Which mars my prospect love, and Oh from thence
    I taste, and take of lose the poisoned pill.

While one coal lives, the rest dead all about
    That still is fire: so your love now burned out
    Tells what you were, though to deceiving led.

The Sun in Summer, and in Winter shows
    Like bright, but not Like hight, fair false made blows
    You shine on me, but you loves heat is dead.
