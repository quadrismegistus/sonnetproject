What mean our Merchant's so with eager minds
    To plough the seas to find rich jewels forth?
Sith in Emaricdulf a thousand kinds
    Are heaped, exceeding wealthy Indias worth:
Then India does her hair afford more gold,
    And thousands silver mines her forehead shows,
More Diamonds then that' Egyptian surges fold,
    Within her eyes rich treasury nature stows:
Her honey breath, but more then honey sweet,
    Exceeds the odours of Arabia:
Those precious ranks continually that meet,
    Are pearls more worth then all America.
Her other parts (proud Cupid's countermate)
Exceed the world for worth, the heavens for state.
