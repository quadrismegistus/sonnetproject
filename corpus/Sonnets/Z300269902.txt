Thou needest God. -- Yes, he can conquer death
    For thee, and open the eternal gates.
    For more than man's love thy sweet spirit waits
And for far more than the one small rose-wreath
That love can give thee. When love's mortal breath
    Flags, thou dost needs the breath that renovates
    The laughing flowers when night's cold dark abates
And when the linnet sings upon the heath.

Yes, woman needs God. I know it well.
    Because I know that I have not the whole
    Eternal force to satisfy thy soul
I love thee more than I can ever tell. -- 
    Woman needs man. Man needs her. And each
    Needs God's heart, -- smiling ever out of reach.
