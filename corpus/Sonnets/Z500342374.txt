What hapless Hap had I now to be born,
In these unhappy Times, and dying Days,
Of this else-doting World? when Good decays,
Love is quenched forth, and Virtue held a Scorn.
When such are only prized, by wretched Ways
Who with a golden Fleece them can adorn,
When Avarice, and Lust, are counted Praise,
And noble Mindes live Orphane-like forlorn.
Why was not I into that golden Age,
When Gold yet was not known? and those black Artes,
By which base Mortalles vildly play their Parts,
And stain with horrid Actes Earths stately Stage?
    Then to have been, Heaven, it had been my Blisse,
    But bless me now, and take me soon from this.
