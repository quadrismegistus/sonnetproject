TO DANTE ALIGHIERI
Sonnet
He interprets Dante Alighieri's Dream, related in the first Sonnet of the Vita Nuova [Footnote: 1Kb]
Of that wherein thou art a questioner
    Considering, I make answer briefly thus,
    Good friend, in wit but little prosperous:
And from my words the truth thou shalt infer, -- 
So Harken to thy dream's interpreter.
    If, found of frame, thou soundly canst discuss
    In reason, -- then, to expel this overplus
Of vapours which hath made thy speech to err,
See that thou lave and purge thy stomach soon.
    But if thou art afflicted with disease,
        Know that I count it mere delirium.
