"With prudence choose a Wife" -- Be thy first care
    Her Virtue, not confined to time or place,
    Or worn for show; but on Religion's base
Well-founded, easy, free, and debonair,

Next rose-cheeked Modesty, beyond compare
    The best cosmetic of the Virgin's face;
    Neatness, which doubles every female grace;
And Temper mild, thy joys and griefs to share;

Beauty in true proportion rather choose
    Than colour, fit to grace thy social board,
        Chear thy chaste bed, and honest offspring rear;
With these seek Prudence well to guide thy house,
    Untainted Birth, and, if thy state afford,
        Do not, when such the prize, for Fortune square.
