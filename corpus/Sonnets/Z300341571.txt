O Codrington, to whom the impassioned lyre
Was never strung in vain! whose faithful soul,
And correspondent passion take the alarm;
Whom pity melts, whom love and transport warm,
Who wishest not the ideas to control
Which it's celestial notes can well inspire.
Whom the same amiable emotions give
(Tho doomed ingratitude and vice to find)
Promoting every social good to live;
Who (though unmeriting) still viewest mankind
With found affection's eye: strains such as these
From thee are sure of welcome; strains where youth
Yet uncorrupted, all it's soul displays,
And suffering love, and firm unshaken truth.
