Proud of our lyric galaxy, I hear
    Of faded Genius with supreme disdain;
    As when we see the miser bend insane
    O'er his full coffers, and in accents drear
Deplore imagined want; -- and thus appear
    To me those moody censors, who complain,
    As Shaftsbury plained [Footnote: 2Kb] in a now boasted reign,
    That "Poesy had left our darkened sphere."
Whence may the present stupid dream be traced
    That now she shines not as in days foregone?
    Perchance neglected, often shine in waste
Her Lights, from number into confluence run,
    More than when, thinly in that' horizon placed,
    Each orb shone separate, and appeared a sun.
