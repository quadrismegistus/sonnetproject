Harvy, dear Kinsman, who in prime of youth
    (When Passions rule, or proud Ambition's call
    Too oft misleads our heedless steps to fall
From the fair paths of Virtue, Peace, and Truth,)

For erring Souls touched with a generous ruth,
    Did'st vow thy service to the God of All;
    Anxious to rescue free the captive thrall
From the old Serpent's deadly poisonous tooth;

Great is the weight, important is the care,
    Of that high office which thou madest thy choice;
        Be strong, be faithful therefore to thy best,
Nor pains, nor prayers, nor fair example spare;
    So thou shalt hear at last that cheering voice,
        "Well done, good Servant, enter into rest."
