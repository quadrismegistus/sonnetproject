Where cliffs arise by winter crowned,
    And through' dark groves of pine around,
Down the deep chasms the snow-fed torrents foam,
Within some hollow, sheltered from the storms,
The Peasant of the Alps his cottage forms,
And builds his humble, happy home.

    Unenvied is the rich domain,
    That far beneath him on the plain
Waves its wide harvests and its olive groves;
More dear to him his hut with plantain thatched,
Where long his unambitious heart attached,
Finds all he wishes, all he loves.

    There dwells the mistress of his heart,
    And Love, who teaches every art,
