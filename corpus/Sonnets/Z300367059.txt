In books it was the Lackawanna Valley.
The Lackawanna Railroad ran through it
separating those on the hill from us.
Lackawanna Place was the toughest block
in the neighbourhood until 1952 when
the temptations and reputation moved
to Church Street where THE PINK DEVILS
had roses tattooed between their thumbs
and forefingers, wore delicate gold
crucifixes on chains around their
brown Italian necks, and carried porno
playing cards from Newark, the city
where parades God lost and statues
died. Newark, were we all had lived.
