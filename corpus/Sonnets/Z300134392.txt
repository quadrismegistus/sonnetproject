James Hutton that true son of fire who said
to Burns 'Aye, man, the rocks melt with the sun'
was sure the age of reason's time was done:
what but imagination could have read
granite boulders back to their melted roots?
And how far back was back, and how far on
would basalt still be basalt, iron iron?
Would second seas re-drown the fossil Brutus's?
'We find no vestige of a beginning,
no prospect of and end.' They died almost
together, poet and geologist,
and lie in wait for hilltop buoys to ring,
or awe the seas gang dry and Scotland's coast
dissolve in crinkled sand and pungent missed.
