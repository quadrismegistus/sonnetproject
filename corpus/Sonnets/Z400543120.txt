Was the aim frustrated by force or guile,
When giants scooped from out the rocky ground,
Tier under tire, this semicirque profound?
(Giants -- the same who built in Erin's isle
That Causeway with incomparable toil!) -- 
O, had this vast theatric structure wound
With finished sweep into a perfect round,
No mightier work had gained the plausive smile
Of all-beholding Ph≈ìbus! But, alas,
Vain earth! false world! Foundations must be laid
In Heaven; for, 'mid the wreck of is and was,
Things incomplete and purposes betrayed
Make sadder transits over thought's optic glass
Than noblest objects utterly decayed.
