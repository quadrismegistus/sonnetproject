I'll love you for a little while, my dear,
And that is all I'll promise you today,
Because if you should dare to come too near,
In self-defense, I should draw more away.
Mine is a hermit-heart that likes to sit
Alone before the fireside and spin,
And any one that comes to dwell with it
Must never try to enter quite within.
You who have known me but a little while,
Beware of me, lest you be disappointed.
I'll gladly give a service or a smile, -- 
But few I welcome as my heart's anointed.
Beware of me, my friend, or you may find
The breath of winter blowing through my mind.
