Emaricdulf love is a holy fire
    That burns unseen, and yet not burning seen:
Free of himself, yet chained with strong desire:
    Conquerd by thee, yet triumphs in thy eine:
An eye-bewitching vision thee in seeming,
    That shadowlike flies from a lovers eyes:
An heaven aspiring spirit void of seeing:
    A gentle God, yet loves to tyrannise:
Bond-slaue to honour, burden of conceit,
    The only God of thine eyes Hyrarkie,
Decay of friendship, grandsire of deceit,
    More then a God, yet wants a monarchy:
Bastard of nature that to heaven did climb,
To seem the misbegotten heir of time.
