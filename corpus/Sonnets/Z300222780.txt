Am I asleep? Your words would never show it,
Barbara,
barbara. All the Barbaras I know
hasten to the stream,
wash & are silent, discovering as the water hits their skin
how very much they love
whatever they love; water tells them.
If you wear your mermaid suit you'll understand.
Bababa. Aàà Eeee I I I u.
I'll brack sat
slew over your lap. Do you hear. Frogs leap,
little spotted frog you're the most
beautiful of all
(green light, pineal emerald), help me to prey!
