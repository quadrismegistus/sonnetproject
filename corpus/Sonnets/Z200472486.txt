Instead of bluest waters from blue sky,
        Grass crocus-pied, with soldanella sown,
        Was dismal swamp, snow-scorched and winter-brown
And overlaid with leaden canopy -- 
Such clouds as hang where souls in torment lie;
        While, scared by avalanche-thunder roaring down,
        The swifts for silence far away had flown,
And the wild fox paused once, then hurried by.

Then over that seething cauldron of the cloud
    High Titlis shone; the hand that guards the pass
        Stood forth Like silver, and we climbed up higher:
    Thence gazing, the disconsolate morass
Became a sea of glory, and a crowd
        Of angels moving on soft waves of fire.
