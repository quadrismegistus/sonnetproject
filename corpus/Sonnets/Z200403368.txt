True Prince of the Apostles, great Saint Paul!
Upon that day, with mighty issues rife,
Which formed and fixed the purpose of thy life,
Not from the blank, impassive heaven did fall
The words that thrilled thee; that imagined call
Was but the echo of the inward voice
That from thy spirit's shrine decreed the choice
Glorious for thee and fraught with good to all.
'It must be true: I saw how Stephen died.
The Lord he served was no mere child of earth.
This faith will mould the Gentile, as the Jew,
To its own image, will make all things new,
And give our worn-out world a second birth.
Henceforth I live to preach the Crucified.'
