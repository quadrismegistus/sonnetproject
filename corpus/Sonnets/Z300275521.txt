See what a full and certain blessing flows
From him, that under God the Earth commands:
For Kings are Types of God, and by their hands
A world of gifts and honours he bestows:
The hopeful tree thus blessed securely grows,
Amidst the waters in a firtile ground;
And shall with leaves, & flowers, & fruits be crowned,
Abundant Due on it the Planter throws.
You are this Plant, my Lord, and must dispose
Your noble soul, those blossoms to receive;
Which ever to the root of Virtue cleave,
As our Apollo by his skill foreshows:
    Our Salomon, in wisdom, and in peace,
    Is now the Prophet of your fair increase.
