In tedious volumes I do not intend
    To write my woes, my woes by love procured,
Nor by my infant muse implore the end
    Of loves true life, this (love) I have abjured:
Only my face (fair deer) shall be the book
    Wherein my daily care shall be rehearsed:
Whereby thou shalt perceive when thou dost look,
    How by thy beauty's darts my heart was pierced.
My eyes shall witness with distilling tears,
    And heart with deep fetched sighs shall manifest
My painful torments caused by griefs and fears,
    And hourly labours mixed with deep unrest:
Both heart, and eyes, and face shall all express,
That only thou art cause of my distress.
