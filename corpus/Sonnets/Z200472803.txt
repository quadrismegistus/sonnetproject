The coals were spent, the village fires burned low
Out flew the banner on the signal mast,
The graybeards questioned far-off sails that passed,
Shading their brows and muttering ay or no;
But when the kindly tide began to flow,
A ship stood up, mysterious, from the vast
Bewildering deep, steered straight ashore, and cast
Her anchors from the stern and from the prow.
Down sank the sea, outshone the coalblack hull,
The jingling carts towards its gangway sped,
With mimic rolls of thunder through' the day
The weary vessel gave her heart away:
Our children found next morn a hollow full
Of sand-locked water, but their friend was gone.
