Parham, if worth concealed in reason's doom
    From want of worth be only once removed;
    Nor can those virtues be esteemed and loved,
Which listless sleep as in the silent tomb;

No longer let thy youthful years consume
    In shy retirement; Thee long since behooved,
    In public life, with courage unreproved,
To show those worths, which bloom so fair at home:

When Virtue, wanting to herself, will shroud
    Behind the veil of shameface'd bashfulness
        Those charms, which Action should produce to view;
No wonder if the forward, bold, and loud,
    In this world's bustling scene, before her press,
        Usurp her name, and rob her of her due.
