Spirits there are inwrought with vilest clay,
    Which bear no God-like stamp of heavenly art,
    Whose envious instincts writhen with bitter smart
    Whene'er they feel some worthier nature's sway.
Ah! who so basely-born, so cursed as they! -- 
    Poor reptiles! -- whose envenomed passion dart
    Back to transfix their own corrupted heart,
    And speed the progress of the soul's decay.
We pity such, yet loathe them. Who can keep
    His honest scorn unspoken, should he see
    These human vipers strive their fangs to steep
In the soul-blood of fame's Nobility?
    Who but is glad when the swift lightnings leap
    Of withering wrath, to blast them utterly?
