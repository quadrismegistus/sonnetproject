You, who to Fam'd Guarini, now he's dead,
    Your Verses consecrate, and Statues rear,
For that sweet Padan Swan your Tears have shed,
    Sweetest that ever did, or will sing here.

Behold this Picture on his Fun'ral Pile,
    Your mournful Spirits ''twill with Joy revive,
Tho' that' Artist cheats your Senses all the while,
    For 'this but Paint which you would swear does live.

This serves to keep our Friend in Memory,
    Since Death hath robbed us of his better Part,
And that he so might live as never to die,
    He drew himself too, but with different Art.

Judge, which with greatest Life and Spirit looks,
Borgianni's Painting, or Guarini's Books.
