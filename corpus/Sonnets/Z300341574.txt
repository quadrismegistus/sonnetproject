Critics have long pronounced our rugged climb,
For the more tender notes of love, unfit;
The nervous is allowed us, the sublime,
Humour unrivaled, and quick-pointed wit.
Hence hath the Muse of Elegy repined,
Nor dared pursue the emotions of her mind.
Say, Quick, if reason this opinion frame?
But while so partial I have ever found
Thy voice to me, so undisposed to blame,
Thy verdict would perhaps be deemed unsound.
Yet, who shall judge, if not the few whose life
Hath been untainted by corruption's train?
Removed from dissipation, folly, strife,
The guilty great, and luxury's odious reign?
