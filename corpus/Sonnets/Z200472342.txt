Born of the far-off careless mountain throng,
What moved thee, Brathay, so to slacken pace?
Was it the soul of sympathetic grace
Which through all Nature's sorrowing is strong?
For slow, with hushing of thy rocky sung,
Between the trees' mellifluous interspace,
Thou passest on towards the holy place
Where tears are shed and memory is long.
How many a brokenhearted man at eve
Has seen in yond still water's golden reach
The Star of Love over Langdale brightlier burn,
And, homeward from that solace loath to turn,
Has felt thy passionate music with him grieve,
Hearing the pent-up silence break to speech!
