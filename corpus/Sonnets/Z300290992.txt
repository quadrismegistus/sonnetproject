Cross these lone downs that' unhappy wanderer strays,
    Views the seas spread, and hears the billows roar;
    While no kind friend his moody footsteps stays,
    Or seeks his bosom's quiet to restore.
Perchance, O Stranger, shouldst thou find these lays,
    Shed tears of pity as thou readest them over:
    For dark and gloomy pass his tedious days,
    While years of lost delight his thoughts deplore.
She, heavenly angel -- (ah! in vain the thought
    These mystic lines will ever meet her eyes -- )
Sees the winged moments speed with rapture fraught,
    And lost in flattery, dreams not of his sighs;
        Yet she perchance will drop a precious tear,
        When calm at length he rests upon his bier.
