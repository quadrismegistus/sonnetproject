Drink. Drugs. Women. Death.
Four best of things to be desired:
Four little foibles that we shared,
The four archangels of our faith.
'Let us,' we said, 'just for a joke
experiment with experience.'
And when the abused spirit broke
under the savaging of sense
we herd the voices of those four
evangelists start whistling Like
fried lark tongues shrieking on a fire
and the drink and the drugs and the women and death
sang up Like sirens from the rocks.
Who is it that their singing mocks?
