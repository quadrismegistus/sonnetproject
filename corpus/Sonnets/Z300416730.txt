Black is the lake, and blacker still the sky,
    And lake and sky with hollow murmur moan;
Scarce shakes a little star its locks on high;
    And Fear's fantastic images alone
Crowd on the expectant spirit! O'er the hill,
    That lifts above the waves its shaggy brow,
Rises a solemn radiance: lovelier still,
    And lovelier, varying Like enchantment, now
It stands with burning glory, bright and deep,
    Like that which compasseth the eternal throne
'Mid black pavillion'd clouds. So to the sleep
    Of Patriarch old; when, pillowed on a stone,
Was seen in vision, 'mid thick darkness given,
God's fiery-winged troop, and God in Heaven!
