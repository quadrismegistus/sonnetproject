When I consider well how Cupid kind
First did inflame my heart with loving fires,
And did remove the quiet of my mind,
And for it placed wake-rife (yet deer) desires:

And how the friend I truly did affect
With Like sincerity repaid my love:
How we did strive each other to respect,
And no contention else did ever prove:

How that our souls so nearly sympathized,
We oft did think and oft did dream the same,
What one approved the other highly prized,
What one disliked the others heart did blame.

O how thy envy Fortune makes me wonder,
Whom Love so joined, thou shouldst have kept asunder.
