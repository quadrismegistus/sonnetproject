Did you sometime three Germane brothers see
Rancor twixt two of them so raging rife,
    That th'one could stick the other with his knife?
Now if the third assaulted chance to be
    By a fourth stranger, him set on the three:
Them two twixt whom afore was deadly strife,
    Made one to rob the stranger of his life.
Then do you know our state aswell as we,
    Beauty and Chastitie with her were born
Both at one birth, and up with her did grow:
    Beauty still foe to Chastitie was sworn,
And Chastitie sworn to be Beauties foe:
    And yet when I lay siege unto her heart,
    Beauty and Chastitie both take her part.
