O Hampden, last of that illustrious line,
    Which greatly stood in Liberty's dear cause,
    Zelous to vindicate our trampled laws
And rights which Britons never can resign,

From the wild claim of impious Right Divine,
    Then when fell Tyranny with harpy claws
    Had seized it's prey, and the devouring jaws
Of that seven-headed Monster, at whose shrine

The Nations bow, threatened our swift decay;
    Neighbor and Friend, farewell -- but not with Thee
        Shall die the record of thy House's fame;
Thy grateful Country shall it's praise convey
    From age to age, and, long as Britain's free,
        Britons shall boast in Hampden's glorious name.
