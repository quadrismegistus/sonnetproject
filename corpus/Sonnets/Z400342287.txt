O sacred Blush impurpling Cheekes pure Skies,
With crimson Wings which spread thee Like the Morn,
O bashful Look sent from those shining Eyes,
Which (though cast down on Earth) couldst Heaven adorn!
O Tongue in which most luscious Nectar lies,
That can at once both bless and make forlorn,
Dear Corrall Lip which Beauty beautifies,
That trembling stood ere that her words were born.
And you her Words, Words no, but Golden Chains
Which did captive mine Ears, ensnare my Soul,
Wise Image of her Minde, Minde that contains
A Power all Power of Senses to control:
    Yee all from Love dissuade so sweetly me,
    That I love more, if more my Love could be.
