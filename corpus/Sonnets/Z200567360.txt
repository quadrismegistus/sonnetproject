Dumb forest belts the Mountains of the Moon,
unverdant, sapless, twilit, bird-deserted;
the shadow of the heart unvisited,
the gray antithesis of golden noon;
root-stricken Fancy in and endless swoon
die but decays not, to new use perverted;
staunch phallic trunks to pretty emblems twisted
question the passing of their sun so soon.

Birds might expect the crystal note of dawn
and in shrill cries anticipate the light;
this vegetation has no way to praise.
The faintest whistle through its stillness drawn,
this weightless fabric sinks to dust and night,
having once bloomed in huge, luxuriant ways.
