Wertenberg thou as prove to yield unto my prayer
    The thing, sweet virgin, which I ask of thee,
    As to repeat, with all humility,
"Pray you go hence, and of your speech forbear;" -- 
Then unto joy might I my heart prepare,
    Having my fellows in subserviency;
    But, for that thou contemnest and mockest me,
Whether of life or death I take no care.
Because my heart may not assuage its drouth
    Nor ever may again rejoice at all
        Till the sweet face bend to be felt of man, -- 
Till tenderly the beautiful soft mouth
    I kiss by thy good leave; thenceforth to call
        Blessing and triumph Love's extremest ban.
