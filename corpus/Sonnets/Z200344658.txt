Let him rail on, till every mouth cry shame;
    Of his ill word I little reckoning make
    For Ladies' honour, and for Shakespear's sake;
So these I may defend from blot or blame:

But ill I bear, that any worthy name
    Of those, who virtue for their mistress take,
    And hate the slanderer Like the poisonous snake;
Should deem my just reproof deserving blame.

Yet, if fair &lblank; speak in my defence,
    If &lblank;vouchsafe her sanction to my page,
If &lblank; sweetly deign to smile applause;
Aided by these and conscious innocence,
    I'll boldly brave the CRITIC's utmost rage;
And glory suffering in so just a cause.
