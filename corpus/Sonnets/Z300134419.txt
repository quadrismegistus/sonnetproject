There was a time when everything was sand.
It drifted down from Findhorn, south south south
and sifted into eye and ear and mouth
on battlefield or bed or plough-bent land.
Loose wars grew sluggish, and the bugles choked.
We saw some live in caves, and even tombs.
Mirages rose from dry Strathspey in plumes.
Scorpions appeared. Heaven's fires were stoked.
But soon they banded to bind dunes in grass,
made cactus farms, ate lizards, sank their wells.
They had their rough strong songs, rougher belief.
Did time preserve them through that narrow pass?
Or are they Guanches under conquerors' spells,
chisel on sorry plinths in Tenerife?
