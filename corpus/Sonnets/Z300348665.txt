We little Men! we crave for miracles;
Something to stare at, to lift up our eyes
And hands in wonder at; as when ghosts rise
At wave of Sorcerer's wand, or ocular spells
Raise up the Dead, or some strange portent tells
Of Nature's order dislocate. We prize
And cherish such poor wonderments, while skies,
And stars, and earth are as dumb oracles,
The true, real wonder is so wondersome,
So far above, beyond us, that it is
No wonder to the many, who go dumb,
Deaf, blind therein, and thereof all sense miss:
Only to greatest minds does vaguely come,
Like vision of the night, faint sense of this.
