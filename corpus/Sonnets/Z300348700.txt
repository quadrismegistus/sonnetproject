Over the dark edge of a precipice
A from bent, half divine, with anguished gaze,
And ever and anon it turned its face,
Yet still reverting thither with fixed eyes.
For in those depths obscure forms seemed to rise
And writhen, that scarce of human boar the trace,
Demoniac half; obliterate the grace
Which should have witnessed high affinities.
Shrink not, bright from, from contact, for their mould
Is thine, and fashioned in the selfsame way,
Though flawed in fiercer fires. All is not gold
That glitters, nor all porcelain Man's clay.
A false step, and thou too mayest loose thy hold,
And not look down on them, but on thee they.
