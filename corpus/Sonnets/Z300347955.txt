From smallest things to greatest by degrees
My soul hath grown; and as, in wondering glee,
I placed the sea-shell at my ear, to be
The mouthpiece of the ocean; till the sea's
Far, multitudinous roar came on the breeze,
And not alone to hear I seemed, but see:
So to the inner ear of soul I thee
Do place, O World, and hear thy voice with ease.
And harmony beyond the Orphean lyre
I catch. The "still small voice," high over all
The tumult of the rushing ages, higher
And fuller, more articulate -- God's call!
Not in the unconsum√®d bush of fire,
But in this wondrous world, in great and small.
