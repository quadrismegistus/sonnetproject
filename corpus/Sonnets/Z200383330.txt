Mvrder, o murder! I can cry no longer,
    Murder, o murder! is there none to aid me?
Life feeble is in force, death is much stronger:
    Then let me die that shame may not upbraid me.
Nothing is left me now but shame or death:
    I fear she fears not foul murders gilded,
Nor do I fear to lose a servile breath,
    I know my blood was given to be spilled.
What is this life but maze of countless strays,
    The enemy of true felicity:
Fitly compared to dreams, to flowers, to plays?
    Oh life, no life to me but misery!
Of shame or death if thou must one,
Make choice of death and both are gone.
