Noble Kalendra Niece to Cynthia;
Endymion with all humility,
Sends to thy blessed self Ourania,
With her accomplished Philosophy,
Long kept she Greekish Ladies company.
And thence arrived in Britannia,
Inquiring for Nymphs of high dignity,
Great Pastorellas of Albania:
Tritonizing Fame blazed Dorotheia.
Thrice renowned, learned, religious,
Thy self, modest, virtuous, Hastinguia,
In the Garland of Nymph's illustrious:
    High prized Branch of Noble Huntington,
    Cherish Ourania, and grace Endymion.
