Unto the fountain where fair Diana chaste
The proud Acteon turned to a Hart
I drove my flock that water sweet to taste,
Cause from the welkin Ph≈ìbus gan depart.
There did I see the nymph whom I admire.
Remembring his locks, of which the yellow hew:
Made blush the beauty's of his curled wire,
Which Jove himself with wonder well might view.
Then read with ire, his tresses she berent,
And weeping hid the beauty of his face:
Whilst I amazed, at his discontent
With tears and sighs do humbly sue for grace:
    But she regarding neither tears nor moan,
    Flies from the fountain leaving me alone.
