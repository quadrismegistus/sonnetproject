Within my little garden is a flower,
    A tuft of flowers, most Like a sheaf of corn,
    The lilac blossomed daisy that is born
At Michaelmas, wrought by the gentle power
Of this sweet Autumn into one bright shower
    Of bloomy beauty; Spring hath nought more fair,
Four sister butterflies inhabit there,
Gay gentle creatures! Round that odorous bower
    They weave their dance of joy the livelong day,
Seeming to bless the sunshine; and at night
    Fold their enameled wings as if to prey.
Home-loving pretty ones! would that I might
    For richer gifts as cheerful tribute pay,
So meet the rising dawn, so hail the parting ray!
