Yon soft star, peering over the sable cloud,
    Sheds its green lustre [Footnote: 1Kb] through' the darksome air. -- 
    Haply in that mild planet's crystal sphere
    Live the freed spirits, over whose timeless shroud
Swell'd my lone sighs, my tearful sorrows flowed.
    They, of these long regrets perhaps aware,
    View them with pitying smiles. -- O! then, if ever
    Your guardian cares may be on me bestowed,
For the pure friendship of our youthful days,
    Ere yet you soared from earth, illume my heart,
    That roves bewildered in Dejection's night,
And led it back to peace! -- as now you dart,
    From your pellucid mansion, the kind rays,
    That through' misleading darkness stream so bright.
