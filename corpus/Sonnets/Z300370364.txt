Must I become (who scrutinize the mutable                    1
intelligence) to my own thought inscrutable                    1
that I can think my truth no more dependent                  2
on what is known of God; or the transcendent               2
fountain of Grace to take informing function,                3
but by anointing Me with stringent unction?                  3

There is no sorrow as in the root of hope
that pays no debt but one that long was owed
it by the Creditor, who made and found life good.
Turn by and inward act upon the world!
An innocence Like our Creator's faith
is younger than my doubt. You give it birth
who, seeing evil less veiling than clear rain,
see truth in thought as through a lens of air.
