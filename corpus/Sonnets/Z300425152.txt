"To shut the gates of mercy on mankind [Footnote 3: 1Kb],"
    By God's mere will excluded, save a few,
    Will they or not, who pass selected through;
To stint the stream of heavenly love; to bind
By strong necessity the human mind
    To sin and endless woe; to hold to view
    The God of all perfection, as untrue,
Unjust, unpardoning, pitiless, unkind:
Is this to preach the Gospel? -- In thy word
    Not such, great God, thy loving-mercy's call
These eyes overjoyed have seen, these ears have herd.
    Thy name is "love [Footnote 4: 1Kb]." By our forefather's fall,
All sinned and died. Forgive me if I've erred,
    Deeming thy Son a ransom paid for all [Footnote 5: 1Kb]!
