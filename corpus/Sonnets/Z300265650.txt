Unhappy I came from my Mother's Womb,
    As She, Oh Blessed She! who gave me Breath,
    Having received the Fatal Stroak of Death,
By weeping Friends was carried to her Tomb.

The Sorrow I expressed, and grievous Cries,
    Love's Tribute were, for her to Heav'n was gone,
    My Coffin, and my Cradle, both were one,
And at her Sunset, mine began to rise.

Wretch, how I quake to think on that sad Day!
Which both for Life and Death at once made way;
    Being gave the Son, and Mother turned to Earth.

Alas, I die! Not that Life hasts so fast,
But that to me each Minute seems the last,
    For I, in Death's cold Arms, received my Birth.
