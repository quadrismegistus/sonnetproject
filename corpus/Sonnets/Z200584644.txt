Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,
    We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
    Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead
Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run
Down some close-covered byway of the air,
    Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,
    Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there
Spend in pure converse our eternal day;
    Think each in each, immediately wise;
Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say
    What this tumultuous body now denies;
And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;
    And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.
