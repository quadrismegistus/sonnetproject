Thou pure and perfect diamond, one, sole,
And single; sum and compliment of bliss,
All-self-containing, most of all-else is.
O Health! Thou indivisible, pure Whole!
Once lost, Life's light unfocus'd is and dull;
And all we see shows false, or tastes amiss.
From thee Love filched the Nectar of his kiss,
And Beauty from thy matchless palette stole
Her living roses! Nay, the Poet's pen
Loses its flourish and its flow divine;
No more stirs Eloquence the hearts of men.
Wit has no point or edge, Fancy no fine
And larklike flights, but mopes in batlike den,
And Soul itself is a forsaken shrine.
