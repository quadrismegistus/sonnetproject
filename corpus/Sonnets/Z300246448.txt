How can we name it "fall," this slow ascent
From dawn to dawn, each purer than the last,
As structure comes back through the golden tent
And shimmering colour floats down to be lost?
How can we name it "fall," this elevation
As all our earthly shelter drops away
And we stand poised as if for revelation
On the brink of another startling day,
And still must live with ever greater height,
And skies more huge and luminous at dusk,
Till we are strained by light and still more light
As if this progress were and imposed task
Demanding of love supreme clarity,
Impersonal, stark as the winter sky.
