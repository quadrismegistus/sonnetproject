VVhen I by thy fair shape did swear,
    And mingled with each Vowe a tear,
            I loved, I loved thee best,
            I swore as I professed;
For all the while you lasted warm and pure,
        My Oathes too did endure;
But once turned faithless to thy self, and Old,
They then with thee incessantly grew Cold.

    I swore my self thy Sacrifice
    By th'Ebon Bows that guard thine eyes,
            Which now are altered White,
            And by the glorious Light
Of both those Stars, of which their Spheres bereft
        Only the Gellie's left:
