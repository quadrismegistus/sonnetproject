Some beauties make a God of flattery,
    And scorn Eliziums eternal types,
Nathes, I abhor such faithless prophesy,
    Least I be beaten with thy virtues stripes,
Wilt thou suruie another world to see?
    Delias sweet Prophet shall the praises sing
Of beauties worth exemplified in thee,
    And thy names honour in his sweet tunes ring:
Thy virtues Collin shall immortalise,
    Collin chased virtues organ sweetest esteemed,
When for Elizas name he did comprise
    Such matter as inventions wonder seemed.
Thy virtues he, thy beauties shall the other.
Christian a new, while I sit by and wonder.
