Ah, Love! ere yet I knew thy fatal power,
Bright glowed the colour of my youthful days,
As on the sultry zone the torrid rays,
    That paint the broad-leaved plantain's glossy bower:
    Calm was my bosom as this silent hour,
When over the deep, scarce herd, the zephyr strays,
'Midst the cool tamarinds indolent plays,
    Nor from the orange shakes its odorous flower: -- 
    But ah! since Love has all my heart possessed,
That desolated heart what sorrows tear!
    Disturb'd, and wild as ocean's troubled breast,
When the hoarse tempest of the night is there!
    Yet my complaining spirit asks no rest,
This bleeding bosom cherishes despair.
