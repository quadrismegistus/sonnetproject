That gooseberry-bush attracts my wandering eyes,
    Whose vivid leaves, so beautifully green,
    First opening in the early spring are seen:
I sit and gaze, and cheerful thoughts arise
Of that delightful season drawing near,
    When those gray woods shall done their summer dress,
    And ring with warbled love and happiness.
I sit and think that soon the advancing year
With golden flowers shall star the verdant vale:
    Then may the enthusiast youth at eve's lone hour,
    Led by mild Melancholy's placid power,
Go listen to the soothing nightingale,
And feed on meditation; while that I
Remain at home, and feed on gooseberry-pie.
