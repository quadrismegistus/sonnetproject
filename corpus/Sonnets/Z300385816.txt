Experienc'd nature in this latter age,
Willing her Master-peece should then be wrought
Such my fair Caelia set on earth's large stage,
As all the Gods in emulation brought;
For they did think, if Nature only might
Brag of her worth, she should insult over them.
Wherefore they 'greed to have and equal right,
That they of her perfection part might claim,
Pallas gave wisdom, Juno stateliness,
And the mild morning gave her modesty:
The Graces carriage, Uenus loveliness,
And chaste Diana choicest chastity:
    Thus heaven and earth their powers did combine
    To make her perfect; kind love make her mine.
