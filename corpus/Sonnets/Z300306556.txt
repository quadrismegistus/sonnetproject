The prose purveyors of doubt, the dismantlers of
Ecstacy, who traffic without a God
In broken metre, would have their Pegasus shod
With discord, not strict numbers. At love they scoff,
And then, in the revolution of anti-love,
Unsheathe chaos, the death of the perjod,
While a new Sibyl, shrieking above her tripod,
Proclaims transformation, treachery, trough.

Yet even the disenchanted, disordered, fret
For lost order. Breakers recall rhyme,
Anchors weighed, and divine proportions set.
As hawk hovers, as compass needle in time
Flies unswerving, steadied, where the stars climb,
Fixed laws hallow what none can forget.
