To live between terms, to live where death
Has his loud picture in the subway ride,
Being amid six million souls, their breath
An empty sung suppressed on every side,
Where the sliding autos' catastrophe
Is a gust passed the curb, where numb and high
The office building rises to its tyranny,
Is our anguished diminution until we die.

Whence, if ever, shall come the actuality
Of a voice speaking the mind's knowing,
The sunlight bright on the green windowshade,
And the self articulate, affectionate, and flowing,
Ease, warmth, light, the utter showing,
When in the white bed all things are made.
