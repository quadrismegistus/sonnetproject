Credulity, thy maw is wondrous wide!
The Boa-constrictor nothing is to thee;
He may be gorged, but thou canst never be.
Could'st thou throw up the messes rank supplied
By that huge knave-fool World to stuff thy hide,
Thou to thy vomit wouldst return, and see
The same huge "cram" in kind both and degree,
Yet swallow, as if for the first time tried.
Thou bloated monster! Surely for one meal
That (in fat) Falstaff "Claimant" might suffice!
Thou with him as Boas with their "gorge" didst deal;
Didst slaver him all over, lick into nice
Presentable shape, so down thy maw to steal;
Yet gapest for more, with open mouth and eyes!
