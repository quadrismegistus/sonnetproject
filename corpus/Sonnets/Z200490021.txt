The perils which Leander took in hand,
Fair Heros love and favour to obtain:
When void of fear securely leaving land,
Through Hellespont he swam to Cestos main,
His dangers should not counterpoise my toil.
If my deer love would once but pity show,
To quench these flames which in my breast do broil,
Or dry these springs which from mine eyes do flow:
Not only Hellespont but Ocean seas,
For his sweet sake to ford I would attempt.
So that my travels would his ire appeas,
My soul from thrall and languish to exempt,
    O what is't not poor I would undertake,
    If labour could my peace with Chloris make.
