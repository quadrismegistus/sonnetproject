Thus was my love, thus was my Ganymed,
    (Heavens joy, world's wonder, nature's fairest work,
    In whose aspect Hope and Despair do lurk)
Made of pure blood in whitest snow ished,
And for sweet Venus only formed his face,
    And his each member delicately framed,
    And last of all fair Ganymede him nam,
His limbs (as their Creatrix) her embrace.
But as for his pure, spotless, virtuous mind,
    Because it sprung of chaste Diana's blood;
    (Goddess of Maids, directress of all good,)
Hit wholly is to chastity inclined.
    And thus it is: as far as I can prove,
    He loves to be beloved, but not to love,
