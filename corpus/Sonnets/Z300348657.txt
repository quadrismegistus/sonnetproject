O Muse beloved, adorable! whom I
Have sought with love more than for woman felt;
For whom I gave up all, to whom I knelt
As some at altars kneel for wealth, thereby
With granted wishes cursed, which cog and lie
Like flatterers, and Fortune but "mis"-spelt
Bring mocking! Not with me so hast thou dealt,
With wealth of heart, and pleasance of ear, eye,
All, all-enriching. And if thou sometime
Dost touch in minor keynote thy grand lyre,
Which our poor mortal utterance sublimes,
'Tis that those deep harmonics may inspire
Our sadder thoughts (Like heaven-wafted chimes,
Dispersed in air), transposed to something higher.
