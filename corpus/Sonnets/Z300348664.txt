Time, who three decades since, placed on thy young
And virgin brow of temporal crown the weight,
On which, amid the many gems and great,
No jewels there a purer radiance flung
Than those pure pearls which Nature herself strung,
Of youth and innocence. Time does abate
The earthlier glories of thy birth and state,
To foil those heavenlier Graces, not among
His Givings or his Takings. He 'it not
That placed on thine anointed head beside
That purer crown of Womanhood, thy lot
High-raised, with sanctions, graces that abide
To hallow, and with titles without blot,
"Wife," "Mother," capped and crowned thy crowned pride.
