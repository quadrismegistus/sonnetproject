Oh beauty Syren, kept with Cyrces rod:
    The fairest good in seem, but foulest ill:
The sweetest plague ordained for man by God,
    The pleasing subject of presumptuous will:
Th'alluring object of unstayed eyes,
    Friended of all, but unto all a foe:
The dearest thing that any creature buys,
    And vainest too: (it serves but for a shoe.)
In seem a heaven, and yet from bliss exiling,
    Paying for truest service, nought but pain:
Young men's undoing: young and old beguiling,
    Mans greatest lose, though thought his greatest gain.
True, that all this with pain enough I prove:
And yet most true, I will Fidessa love.
