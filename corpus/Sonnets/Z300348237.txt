Fair Commerce, many-breasted, and with lap
Filled with earth's varied store from pole to pole,
All winds thy wings are, for thee all seas roll.
Thine the true cornucopia; thine to wrap
The naked savage, spin his cotton, shape
His life by lower wants for higher goal;
And cloth, as erst his body, then his soul,
And near to God draw him not far from ape!
Handmaid of Civilisation, in thy train,
Tho' not of thee, nor calling themselves thine,
The Muses and the Graces, to thy gain
For recognition of their gifts divine
Indebted come. By thee sweet Peace does reign,
And Earth's waste places laugh with corn and wine!
