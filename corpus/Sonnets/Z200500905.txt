How many thoughts have traveled through my mind
    Within this one brief hour, thoughts dark and bright;
    Soft flowering thoughts, and thoughts of stormy might,
And scarce a trace have they now left behind -- 
Gone Like a breath of swift and arrowy wind.
    My soul hath known their darkness and their light;
    Their tenderer influence and tempestuous flight:
And knows no more of them -- thus disenshrined,
Fled, lost, forgotten -- never to be recalled.
    Oh! well may all things fleet from us below,
Since our own thoughts we may not bind, unthralled
    By our weak will, they to some ocean flow,
Those streams of soul -- from our sense barred and walled -- 
Winged children of the mind! ah! whither do you go?
