Sonnet
A Trance of Love
Vanquished and weary was my soul in me,
    And my heart gasped after its much lament,
    When sleep at length the painful languor sent.
And, as I slept (and wept incessantly), -- 
Through the keen fixedness of memory
    Which I had cherished ere my tears were spent,
    I passed to a new trance of wonderment;
Wherein a visible spirit I could see,
Which caught me up, and boar me to a place
    Where my most gentle lady was alone;
        And still before us a fire seemed to move,
    Out of the which methought there came a moan
