Would'st thou then have me tempt the comic scene
    Of gay Thalia? used so long to tread
    The gloomy paths of sorrow's cypress shade;
And the lorn lay with sighs and tears to stain?
Alas! how much unfit her sprightly vein,
    Arduous to try! -- and seek the sunny mead,
    And bowers of roses, where she loves to led
The sportive Subject's of her golden reign!
Enough for me, if still, to sooth my days,
    Her fair and pensive sister condescend,
With tearful smile to bless my simple lays;
    Enough, if her soft notes she sometime lend,
To gain for me of feeling hearts the praise,
    And chiefly thine, my ever partial friend!
