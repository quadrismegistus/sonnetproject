It was high summer, and the sun was hight.
We flew up over Perthshire, following
Christo's great-granddaughter in her swing-wing
converted crop-sprayer till plastic shot
above Schiehallion from her spinneret
Scotland-shaped and Scotland-sized, descended
silent, tough, translucent, light-attended,
catching that shoal of contours in one net.
Beneath it, what amazement; anger; some
stretching in wonder at a sky to touch;
chaos at airports, stunned larks, no more rain!
It would not burn, it would not cut. The hum
of civic protest probed Like Dali's crutch.
Children ran wild under that counterpane.
