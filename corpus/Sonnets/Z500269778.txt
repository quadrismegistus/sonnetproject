A poet loved a nightingale -- and she
    Would sing to him, and he was speechless yet,
    But vowed solicitude to weave a net
Wherein the tender bird entrapped might be,
And when the moon was silver on the sea,
    And all the leaves with silver splashes wet,
    He came to that sweet cliff-top wood to set
The cunning of his hand beneath the tree;
    And as he passed along the dusty road
He met a boy who swung a wicker cage,
"Some linnet or a chaffinch, I'll engage,"
    He commented contemptuous, as he strode
    Towards the trysting-tree with heart that glowed,
A war of mingled melody to wage;
