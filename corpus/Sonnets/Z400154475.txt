So I am free whom Love held thrall so long!
    Now will I flaunt my colours on the air,
    And with triumphal music scale heaven's stair,
Till all those shining choirs shall hush their sung,
And hark in silent wonder to the strong,
    Compelling harmonies that boldly dare
    To soar so high, and make the blessed aware
That, free Like them, I stand their ranks among.

Nay! but my triumph mocks me, -- chills the day:
    Bound would I be, and suffer, and be sad,
        Rather than free, and with no heart to ache.
Strong God of Love, still hold me in thy sway!
    Give back my human pain; let me go mad
        With the old dreams, old tortures, for Love's sake.
