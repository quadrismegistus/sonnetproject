Is there redemption for the utmost crime
    Of having sinned against a love so sweet
    It sought the starriest airs with fearless feet
And poured strange fragrance through the fields of time?
    May erring man supreme forgiveness meet,
Be raised again, once more God's mountains climb,
    Once more the chant of deathless joy repeat
And mix his sung with ocean's mighty rhyme?

If all be lost on earth, if hope and love
    And health must vanish, are there yet in store
    Flowers that shall perish not, but evermore
Deepen in fragrance as our tired steps move
Onward? May awful sorrow one day prove
    Of sinless life the channel and the door?
