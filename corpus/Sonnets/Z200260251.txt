For thee I cull no fair poetic flowers,
    By Genius borrowed from th'inspiring Muse;
Tho' oft her votary at the evening hours,
As pensive wandering near her peaceful bowers,
    Yet she, coy nymph, her aid did still refuse.
Her smile no longer courting, thus I said -- 
    'The world will tell in vain I waste my time
    'Weaving in lowly cot my humble rhyme:
'Yes! -- I will straight pursue some kinder maid,
    'Nor envy him who soars in bold sublime.'
Then Fancy thy fair from did quick present:
    To thee I send my artless songs of love;
Nor will I think one hour hath been misspent,
    Should thou, sweet maid, one artless sung approve.
