To this fair Island, in the western sea,
From green Devonia's vales I came -- to die;
In vain the fondest care, serenest sky,
Long had gone forth that' immutable decree:

Long had I been resigned -- Ye, only, Ye,
Who watched my slow decline with anxious eye,
To Earth still bound me with affection's tie;
For Love made known what sorrow yours would be:

Yet mourn not -- All the shadowy scene must leave
At morn or noon, even those, who stay awhile,
Count but a few brief hours, and sink at eve:

Like Israel's Prince resume your wonted style;
Ye cannot doubt my bliss, you may not grieve,
Whilst in your memory lives my dying smile.
