Sweet Moralist, whose generous labors tend
    With ceaseless diligence to guide the mind,
    In the wild maze of error wandering blind,
To Virtue Truth and Honour, glorious end

Of glorious toils! vainly would I commend,
    In numbers worthy of your sense refined,
    This last great work, which leaves all praise behind,
And justly styles You Of Mankind the Friend:

Pleasure with profit artful while you blend,
    And now the fancy, now the judgement feed
        With grateful change, which every passion sways;
Numbers, who never to graver lore attend,
    Caught by the charm, grow virtuous as they read,
        And lives reformed shall give you genuine praise.
