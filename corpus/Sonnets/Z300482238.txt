In April's gilded morn when south winds blow,
    And gently shake the hawthorn's silver crown,
    Wafting its scent the forest-glade down,
    The dewy shelter of the bounding do,
Then, under trees, soft tufts of primrose show
    Their palely-yellowing flowers; -- to the moist sun
    Blue harebells peep, while cowslips stand unblown,
    Plighted to riper May; -- and lavish flow
The lark's loud carols in the wilds of air.
    O! not to Nature's glad enthusiast cling
    Avarice, and pride. -- Thro' her now blooming sphere
Charmed as he roves, his thoughts enraptured spring
    To Him, who gives frail man's appointed time
    These cheering hours of promise and of prime.
