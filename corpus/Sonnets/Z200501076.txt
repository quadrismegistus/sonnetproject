To thee I drink this parting cup, full brimmed -- 
    This cup of and unfathomable woe! -- 
    And drain each drop of fire! -- yet must I go!
My heart is wounded and my sighed is dimmed;
That cup with every poison-dew seems rimmed:
    Fear, Self-reproach, Suspense together flow,
    And all their torments I too keenly know.
No matter! -- for Love's lamp is fed and trimmed;
    And this shall light my sepulchre on earth.
Life! thou long torture! -- let thy rack but be
    With buds of Hope's young roses flowering forth,
Adorned and brightened, and 'this well with me!
    Farewell! farewell! -- I murmur not; 'this worth
Our while to weep, if through our tears Heaven's smiles we see!
