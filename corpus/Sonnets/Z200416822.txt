On the gray rock with tumbling fragments rude,
    The conscious castle, proud in ruin, frowns,
While far beneath as rolls the weltering flood,
    Each feebler found its deep-toned murmur drowns.

From this steep crag, where Terrour leagued with Power
    Invasion's troubled tempest would defy,
Dimly is seen the [Footnote: 1Kb] distant cliff to tower,
    Or the faint ocean mingling with the sky.

Amid the tangles of the briared dell,
    A high arched abbey's shrub-twined fragments show,
Where many a sinking stone forgets to tell
    To Fame's deaf ear, the dust that lies below.

Rude scene! 'till thou'rt no more, shall Wildness claim
"A local habitation, and a name."
