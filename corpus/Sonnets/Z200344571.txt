Homage to love, duty to thee my deer,
    Dear mistress of my thoughts, Queen of my joy:
Then my life's gracious planet bright appear,
    My hearts deep grief and sorrow to destroy.
Be not (I thee beseech) my cares maintainer:
    For in thy power it lies to save or strike,
To kill the grief, or else the griefs retainer,
    With love or hate the infant of dislike.
O if that cruel love did not command
    To slay my heart without remorse or pity:
Or if he did that sad doom countermand,
    And be a gracious Queen of gentle mercy:
Sweet show thy self divine in being pitiful,
For nature of the gods is to be merciful.
