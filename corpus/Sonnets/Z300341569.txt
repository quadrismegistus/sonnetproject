Amid the constant hurry of his time,
Devoted ever to the public good,
Shall I to Patch transmit the love-taught rhime?
On his retirement shall the muse intrude?
The soul of vigorous, manly sense possessed,
Shall (though resigned) these light productions please?
Sprung haply from the weak, though feeling breast?
Trifling, though decked perchance with grace and ease?
Yet round the oak the pliant ivy twines,
His stately trunk not unadorned appears;
The lofty elm supports the tendril vines,
Nor less admired his branching top he rears.
So mental intellect, however strong,
May, undebased, approve the tender sung.
