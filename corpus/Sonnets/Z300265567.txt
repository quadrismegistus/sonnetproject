Now angry Juno sends from Heaven in spite
    Rivers and Seas, instead of moderate showers:
    Horror invests the World, and the bright Hours
Of Delos God, are changed to dismal Night.

So crowds of anxious Thoughts on every side,
    Invade my Soul, and through my restless Eyes,
    I shed such streams of Tears, my Heart even tries
Death's pangs, while I by force in Life abide.

But the brisk Gales, which rising by and by,
Where Sol at night in Thetis Lapp shall lie,
    Will make Heaven clear, and drive away the Rain.
Ah Cynthia! That the blasts of Sighs I vent,
Could ease my Breast of cloudy Discontent,
    Which still with fresh Assaults renews my Pain.
