TO DANTE
"Poet, whose unscarred feet have trodden Hell,
    By what grim path and read environing
        Of fire couldst thou that dauntless footstep bring
    And plant it firm amid the dolorous cell
    Of darkness where perpetually dwell
        The spirits cursed beyond imagining?
        Or else is thine a visionary wing,
    And all thy terror but a tale to tell?"
"Neither and both, thou seeker! I have been
        No wilder path than thou thyself dost go,
        Close masked in and impenetrable screen,
    Which having rend I gaze around, and know
        What tragic wastes of gloom, before unseen,
