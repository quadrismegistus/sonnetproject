Arraign'd poor captive at the bar I stand,
    The bar of Beauty, bar to all my joys,
And up I hold my ever-trembling hand,
    Wishing or life or death to end annoys.
And when the Judge does question of the gilded,
    And bids me speak, then sorrow shuts up words:
Yea though he say, speak boldly what thou wilt,
    Yet my confused affects no speech affords.
For why (alas) my passion have no bound,
    For fear of death that penetrates so near:
And still one grief another does confound,
    Yet does at length a way to speech appear.
Then (for I speak too late) the Judge does give
His sentence that in prison I shall live.
