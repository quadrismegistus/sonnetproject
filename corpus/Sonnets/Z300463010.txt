Amid this [Footnote: 1Kb] Scene of varied Beauty placed,
        Where Nature's wild Simplicity, refined
        To Prospects that might charm even Mason's Mind,
Veils the fair Art, which lives in Courtenay's Taste;
Let us, my Laura, no vain Wishes waste;
        But to the humbler Lot of Life resigned
Be ours, when Evening's pensive Shadows haste
        O'er the dark Trees and paler Lawn, to bind
Contentment's modest Wreath around the Brows
    Of wedded Love, that sighing, oft renews
The Memory of its fondly-storied Vows;
    Or smiling on the Day overpassed, reviews
Each Joy the Wife -- the Mother can impart,
To rivet, in Esteem, the Husband's Heart!
