Around my Porch and lowly Casement spread,
    The Myrtle never-sear, and gadding Vine,
    With fragrant Sweet-Briar love to intertwine;
    And in my Garden's box-encircled bed,
The Pansie pied, and Musk-Rose white and read,
    The Pink and Tulip, and Honied Woodbine,
    Fling odours round; the flaunting Eglantine
    Decks my trim fence, 'neath which, by silence led,
The Wren hath wisely placed her mossy cell;
    And, far from noise, in courtly land so rife,
    Nestles her young to rest, and warbles well.
Here in this safe retreat and peaceful glen
    I pass my sober moments, far from Men;
    Nor wishing Death too soon, nor asking Life.
