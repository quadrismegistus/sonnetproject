When pensive on that Portraiture I gaze,
    Where my four Brothers round about me stand,
    And four fair Sisters smile with graces bland,
The goodly monument of happier days;

And think how soon insatiate Death, who preys
    On all, has cropped the rest with ruthless hand;
    While only I survive of all that band,
Which one chaste bed did to my Father raise;

It seems that Like a Column left alone,
    The tottering remnant of some splendid Fane,
        Scape'd from the fury of the barbarous Gaul,
And wasting Time, which has the rest overthrown;
    Amidst our House's ruins I remain
        Single, unpropped, and nodding to my fall.
