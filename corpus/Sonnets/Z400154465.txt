I tire of phantoms that my heart distrain,
    That claim their own, and will not let me rest,
    That mock me with old laughter, long-hushed jest,
And of the love I promised once are fain.
Shall I not seek some opiate for pain,
    And drug the ceaseless ache within my breast -- 
    Bid Memory "Hence!" as and unwelcome guest,
And smite the joyous chords of Life again?

Nay! Then must I forbid the dead to speak,
    And do the holy passed unholy wrong -- 
        Disown its claim -- refuse to pay its debt -- 
All Heaven would look with scorn on one so weak!
    I choose, instead, to suffer and be strong -- 
        Give me no Lethe! I will not forget.
