As when a lion, mad with hunger, springs
    To seize the unguarded shepherd by surprise,
Fear in a moment lends the victim wings;
    To some broad elm or ancient oak he flies,
Climbs for his life, amid the branches cowers,
    And sees the' infuriate bruit, with ramping paws,
Leap at the trunk, and, wearying all his powers,
    Spurn the lose sand, and grind his foaming jaws.

So she, whom hell's fierce lion marked for prey,
    Flies to the tree of life's extended arms,
The cross of Calvary, -- which, night and day,
    Yields shade, and rest, and refuge from alarms;
Whence she beholds the baffled fiend again,
Gnashing his teeth, slink back to his old den.
