Your mind was Like a primer newly bought,
Without the pages cut, with words unlearned
And lessons all untried. Now it has turned
Familiar as myself. What I had thought
Was much too deep to master, has been taught
To me each day in little ways concerned
With common things, until there has been burned
Deep in my heart the insight that I sought.
Now it is done. I find my work grown play.
I turn the pages one by one and find
Only the common words of every day. -- 
But I had best been ignorant and blind -- 
For I have found it now, in dull dismay,
An honest book, but one to leave behind.
