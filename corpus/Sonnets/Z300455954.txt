As some lone mourner, with a pilgrim's love,
    Roams to the distant mansions of the dead,
    Hangs over each relic with a joy above
    What festal pleasures ever boast to shed.
So, by poetic sorrow fondly led,
    Thro' Amwell's widowed scenes I secret rove,
    Retrace each path where Theron used to tread,
    And pierce afresh each inspirative grove;
With lingering sadness pause around the spot
    Where art and nature strove with taste to blend,
    Where Theron delved his subterranean grot,
Theron, the Muse's and the Poet's friend!
    Alas! that it should prove my hapless lot
    To see the cypress over his pale urn bend.
