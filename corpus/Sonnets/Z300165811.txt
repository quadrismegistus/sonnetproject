Lover devout of many a lonely place,
    Mute gossamer guest of dimness and repose,
    As loyally as lily or balmy rose
Obey the sunshine, does your delicate lace
Hang somber filaments where the stealthy pace
    Of time's disfeaturing footstep vaguely goes, -- 
    From shelves that bear old ponderous folios,
To some poor yellowing portrait's dusty face!

Yet though in solemn nooks you rightly reign,
    Here, woven across the green of this fresh vine,
        The dignity of your wonted state you loose;
For now the halcyon morning on your skein,
    As though to merrily challenge its dark sign,
        Strings the warm splendors of her jeweling dews!
