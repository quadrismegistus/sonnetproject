When they did greet me father, sudden awe
    Weigh'd down my spirit: I retired and knelt
    Seeking the throne of grace, but inly felt
No heavenly visitation upward draw
My feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart.
    Ah me! before the Eternal Sire I brought
    Th' unquiet silence of confused thought
And shapeless feelings: my overwhelmed heart
Trembled, and vacant tears streamed down my face.
And now once more, O Lord! to thee I bend,
    Lover of souls! and groan for future grace,
That ere my babe youth's perilous maze have trod,
    Thy overshadowing Spirit may descend,
    And he be born again, a child of God.
