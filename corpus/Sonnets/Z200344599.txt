On Tellus bosom spring two fragrant flowers,
    The milkwhite Lily, and the blushing Rose,
Which dainty Flora for to deck her bowers
    Aboue all other colours chiefly chosen.
These in my mistress checks both empire holding
    In emulation of each others hew,
Continually may be discerned folding
    Beauty in looks, and majesty in view.
Sometime they meet, and in a Scarlet field
    War with rebellious hearts neglecting duty,
And never cease, until they force to yield
    Them coward captives conquered by beauty.
Emaricdulf thus didst thou play the foe,
And I the rebel, and was conquered so.
