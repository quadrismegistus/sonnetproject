I lie here very still; and he draws nigh
    To stand beside me, and to look his last
    On her who far beyond his ken has passed,
Yet rests here, 'neath his touch, so tranquilly;
From the shut lips there comes no least, low sighs;
    No eyelash quivers, and white Death holds fast,
    In long embrace by longing dreams forecast,
The life that had known Life's satiety.

I laughed and loved and wept, and now I sleep;
    And that were best of all, if no dreams come
To mar this quietude of slumber, deep
    And still as some deep night when winds are dumb;
But he, my mourner, wherefore should he keep
    Intrusive vigil round my silent home?
