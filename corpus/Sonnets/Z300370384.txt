Dark (blank dark) incised with intricate, surcharged
you; you, first dead friend. Day break gun. Birds leave
leaning night towers for fields unbudded, stone-fenced
numb. In this the voided womb of cult (splayed vines sag
looped between bathed mulberries and behind poplars
the carven hills hang taut) I jump squatting and I would cry out loud:

If Dawn follow the far Dark, can Spring far follow Winter?
Budding tear-f≈ìtus tear my throat; I weep, therefore I grieve.

You (blank indelible
image of Death on cypress-measured air)
say with a voice without found:
Un-think these things.
O! Penetrable shade,
how calmly you look out.
