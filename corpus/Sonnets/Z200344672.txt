Brother and Friend, whom Heav'n's all-gracious hand,
    In lieu of Brethren and of Friends deceased,
    To me a solace and support has raised,
And bound by Virtue's ever-sacred band;

To future times fair shall thy memory stand,
    (If aught of mine to future times at lest
    Can reach,) and, for fraternal kindness blessed,
Wide as good Proculeius' fame expand.

The found remembrance of Maria's love
    Her friends and kindred to thy heart endears;
        With equal warmth thou dost their friendship meet,
And generous acts thy true affection prove;
    Thy kind compassion dries the Widows tears,
        And guides the lonely Orphan's wandering Feet.
