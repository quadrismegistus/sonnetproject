You Hope's, you Bankerouts of time and youth,
You shadows which Cephisus son did chase,
You fruits which fled from Tantalus hungry mouth,
Go hence from me and take your dwelling place
[]
With such Chameleons as can live on Air,
With such as buy into there own disgrace
Thurinus' smoke for good and solid beware.
    For me, I rather cherish true despair
Then entertain such Hope's as do betray me,
For me, I rather stoop to such a care
As cuts me short, then such as does belie me,
    A hopeless life is Arm'd against all pain,
    It doubles grief to hope and not obtain.
