With lyre Orphean, see a barred explore
    The central caverns of the mornless night,
    Till now never echoing to Ã†onian rite
    He comes! -- and lo! upon the sparry floor,
Advance to welcome him, each sister power,
    Petra, stern queen, Fossilia, cold and bright,
    And call their gnomes, to marshal in his sighed
    The gelid incrust, and the veined over,
And flashing gem. -- Then, while his songs portray
    The mystic virtues gold and gems acquire,
    With every charm that mineral scenes display,
Th' imperial sisters praise the daring lyre,
    And grateful hail its new and powerful lay,
    That seats them high amid the Muses' choir.
