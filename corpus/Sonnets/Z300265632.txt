Oh Eyes! Our Sun's extinct, and at and End,
    Or rather glorified in Heav'n does shine;
There shall we see her, there does she attend,
And at our long Delay perchance repine.

Alas, my Ears, the Voice you loved to hear,
    Is now raised up to the CÅ“lestial Choire;
And you, my Feet, she's gone that used to steer
    Your Course, where you till Death can never aspire.

Cannot my Soul nor Body yet be free?
    'Twas not my Fault, you this Occasion lost;
    That Seeing, Hearing, Finding her you're crossed:
Blame Death, or rather blessed be ever He,

Who binds and looses, makes and can destroy,
And when Life's done crowns with Eternal Joy.
