Weep now no more mine eyes, but be you drowned
    In your own tears, so many years distilled:
And let her know that at them long hath frowned,
    That you can weep no more, although she willed.
This hap her cruelty hath her alotten,
    Who whilom was commaundres of each part:
That now her proper griefs must be forgotten,
    By those true outward signs of inward smart.
For how c&abar; he that hath not one tear left him,
    Streame out those floods that's due unto her moaning?
When both of eyes and tears she hath bereft him:
    Oh verti'le signify my grief with groaning!
True sighs, true groans shall echo in the air,
And say Fidessa (though most cruel) is most fair.
