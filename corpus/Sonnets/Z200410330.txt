Peace my hearts blab, be ever dumb,
Sorrowes speak loud without a tongue:
And my perplexed thoughts forbear
To breath your selves in any ear:
    Tis scarce a true or manly grief
    Which gaddes abroad to find relief.

Was ever stomach that lacked meat
Nourisht by what another eat?
Can I bestow it, or will woe
Forsake me when I bid it go?
    Then Isle believe a wounded breast
    May heal by shrift, and purchase rest.

But if imparting it I do
Not ease my self, but trouble two,
