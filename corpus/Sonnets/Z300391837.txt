DEATH OF LAZARUS.
    One grief, one faith, O sisters of the dead!
        Was in your bosoms -- thou, whose steps, made fleet
    By keen hope fluttering in the heart which bled,
        Bore thee, as wings, the Lord of Life to greet;
        And thou, that duteous in thy still retreat
    Didst wait his summons -- then with reverend love
        Fall weeping at the blessed Deliverer's feet,
    Whom even to heavenly tears thy woe could move.
    And which to Him, the All Seeing and All Just,
    Was loveliest, that quick zeal, or lowly trust?
Oh! question not, and let no law be given
    To those unveilings of its deepest shrine,
    By the wrung spirit made in outward sign:
