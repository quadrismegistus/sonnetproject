Pick me no daffodil. Cut me no rose.
Bring me no honeysuckle vine. The pang
Of beauty that must die, yet ever grows
More beautiful in dying, when the fang
Of dissolution shall assail the heart,
Is sacrifice too poignant. Do not ask it.
Let beauty be eternal, and apart.
Cherish immortal flowers for your basket,
That needs not die for gathering. Who knows
What may have been the reason for that vine?
Leave to the be the liquour of his rose,
For human lips too highly spiced a wine.
Repent too late, and things which were immortal
Are gone for garlanding and earthly portal.
