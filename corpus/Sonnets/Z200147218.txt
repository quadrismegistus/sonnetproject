"Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better."
As the uncertain twittering of the birds,
    Striving with Winter, which has been so long,
Dies inarticulate -- ending not in sung -- 
    So did my voice, with many plaintive words,
Strive, in the winter of my grief, to sing,
    But died in silence -- they could not be spoken -- 
Because, within my heart, there was no spring
    Of joy to call them forth -- my heart was broken!
For Disappointment's frost had withered up
    Affection's flowers! -- Youth's Garden now was bore!
I have drunk poison from Death's empty cup,
    Whose bottom now contains the dregs of care,
Which mock my lips with bitterness, to think
