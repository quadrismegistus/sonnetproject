She lies before thee a pale, pulseless Land;
No more her great eyes burn with hopeful lights;
About her worn and helmless droop her Knights,
A shattered weapon in each dead right hand:
The trumpets that aroused that warrior band
To pluck fresh honour from and hundred fights,
Seem distant now as echoes up the heights
Of fabulous Legend born to realms unscanned;
Yet fearest thou this Queen Titan from her rest
May start while thou art slumbering? -- found again
Her ringing battle-cry over mount and plain,
With Conquest blazing on her fiery crest?
Aye! SUCH thy dread! hence to all Earth's disdain,
Thy ruthless sword still gores her prostrate breast!
