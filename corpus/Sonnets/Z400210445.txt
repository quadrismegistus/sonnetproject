The jokes, the feuds, the puns, the punishments,
This traditional man being brave, going in grace,
Finding the structure of lives more than perfected line;
The forms of poetry are his time and space.
He's quirky, he rhymes Like daily life; light wine
Is all his flavor, till fierce reverence
Turns delicatessen into delicatesse   -- 
The man who anthologizes experience.

He is anthologized; Like a wave of the sea
He is here, he is there, he changes;      impossibly,
He is blue surface, green suspended, the dark deep notes.
A stain of brilliance spreading upward floats
In luminous air; we are luminous, he makes us be
The jokes of Job and Heine's anecdotes.
