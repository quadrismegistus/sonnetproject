Leaving her I loved in the picturesque winter
Flanked by cathedrals and daunted by the north sea
To celebrate alone the vernal festival,
I returned, I wept. In the mind I could not stint her
Of the swans or cypresses, I found that all
My memories of her face and words were woven
Into a pattern of and intricate delicacy,
A tapestry, where a formal wind had driven
Many and unapproached, and agonising head;
There that girl's gold soon-stained medallion, there
The cold symmetrical features of the bluecoat boy,
There all desires forgotten and dreams half-dead ...
But that one face that might have made me joy,
Where had her paleness gone, and her black stare?
