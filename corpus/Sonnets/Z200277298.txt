Marvell, that single deed of thine shall write,
    Upon the memories of men, thy name,
    Until that' eternal sun of Shakspeare's fame
    The darkening earth shall see go down in night, -- 
    Till thy land's language shall be, to the sighed
    Of those who dwell upon the earth, the same
    As the old characters cut to proclaim
    Deeds done in the world's childhood, when the light
    Streamed down in mighty cities that are not.
    Wiser in this than England's wisest, thou
    Didst welcome poverty to be thy lot,
    With lofty independence joined; and now,
    Weighing, against thy living glory, gold,
Who, for the worthless dross, would fell what Bacon sold?
