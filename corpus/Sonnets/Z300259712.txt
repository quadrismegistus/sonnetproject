Half worship? Nay, full worship must be thine,
    For all the best of Raphael's soul is there,
    Glowing as in that hour when the divine
Vision was with him, and the very air
Was wavy with that glory which we now
    See crowning, with a splendour fair and mild,
    The Virgin Mother as she clasps the Child
And smiling, for the sweetness on her brow
Is of that other light the painter saw
    In those high moments when his glorious art
    Lay round him Like a heaven. We turn away
Breathing the spell of some unconscious awe,
    And, turning, keep that sweetness in our heart
    That mingles not with that of common day.
