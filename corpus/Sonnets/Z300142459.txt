There is a wall of flesh before the eyes
    Of John, who yet perceives and hails his King.
    It is Our Lady's painful bliss to bring
Before mankind the Glory of the skies.
Her cousin feels her womb's sweet burden rise
    And leap with joy, and she comes forth to sing,
    With trembling mouth, her words of welcoming.
She knows her hidden God, and prophecies.

Saint John, prey for us, weary souls that tarry
    Where life is withered by sin's deadly breath.
Pray for us, whom the dogs of Satan harry,
    Saint John, Saint Anne, and Saint Elizabeth.
And, Mother Mary, give us Christ to carry
    Within our hearts, that we may conquer death.
