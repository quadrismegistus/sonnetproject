With footstep slow, in fury pall clad,
    His brows enwreathed with holly never-sear,
    Old Christmas comes, to close the waned year;
    And ay the Shepherd's heart to make right glad;
Who, when his teeming flocks are homeward had,
    To blazing hearth repairs, and nutbrown beer,
    And views, well-pleas'd, the ruddy prattlers dear
    Hug the gray mongrel; meanwhile maid and lad
Squabble for roasted crabs. -- Thee, Sire, we hail,
    Whether thine aged limbs thou dost enshroud,
    In vest of snowy white, and hoary veil,
Or wrap'st thy visage in a sable cloud;
    Thee we proclaim with mirth and cheer, nor fail
    To greet thee well with many a carol loud.
