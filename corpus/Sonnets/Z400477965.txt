Sweet twining hedgeflowers wind-stirred in no wise
    On this June day; and hand that clings in hand: -- 
    Still glades; and meeting faces scarcely fanned: -- 
An osier-odoured stream that draws the skies
Deep to its heart; and mirrored eyes in eyes: -- 
    Fresh hourly wonder over the Summer land
    Of light and cloud; and two souls softly spanned
With one o'erarching heaven of smiles and sighs: -- 

Even such their path, whose bodies lean unto
    Each other's visible sweetness amorously, -- 
    Whose passionate hearts lean by Love's high decree
Together on his heart for ever true,
As the cloud-foaming firmamental blue
    Rests on the blue line of a foamless sea.
