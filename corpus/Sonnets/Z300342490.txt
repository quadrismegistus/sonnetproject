That space, where raging Waves do now divide
From the great Continent our happy Isle,
Was sometime Land, and where tall Shippes do glide,
Once with deer Arte the crooked Plough did tile:
Once those fair Bounds stretched out so far and wide,
Where Towns, no, Shires enwall'd, endear each mile,
Were all ignoble Sea, and marish vile
Where Proteus Flockes danced measures to the Tide.
So Age transforming all still forward runs,
No wonder though the Earth does change her face,
New Manners, Pleasures new, turn with new Suns,
Locks now Like Gold grow to and hoary grace;
    Nay, Mindes rare shape does change, that lies despised
    Which was so deer of late and highly prised.
