While Summer roses all their glory yield
    To crown the votary of love and joy,
    Misfortune's victim hails, with many a sighs,
    Thee, scarlet Poppy of the pathless field,
Gaudy, yet wild and lone; no leaf to shield
    Thy flaccid vest, that as the gale blows high,
    Flaps, and alternate folds around thy head. -- 
    So stands in the long grass a love-crazed maid,
Smiling aghast; while stream to every wind
    Her garish ribbons, smeared with dust and rain;
    But brainsick visions cheat her tortured mind,
And bring false peace. Thus, lulling grief and pain,
    Kind dreams oblivious from thy juice proceed,
    Thou flimsy, showy, melancholy Weed.
