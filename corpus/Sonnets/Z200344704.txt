O friend, in sad affliction's useful school
    Long trained and tutored, hard to humane sense,
    And dark appear that' awards of Providence,
Though Truth and Goodness be their constant rule;

The word of Truth has said, and reason cool
    Subscribes, that wise and kind Omnipotence
    Does oft the bitter cup in love dispense;
While draughts of pleasure lull the prosperous fool:

Omniscience knows, and Goodness will bestow,
    What's rightest, fittest, best; let humble man
        With faith and patience bow submissive down,
Secure, that God delights not in our woe;
    And, when we have measure'd out this life's short span,
        If soar the trial, bright will be the crown.
