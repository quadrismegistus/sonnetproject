Look home my Soul, defer not to repent,
Time ever runs: in sloth great dangers lie:
Impostumde soars the patient most torment,
While wounds are green the salve with speed apply,
Workes once adjourned good success seldom try,
Delay's attended still with discontent:
Thrise happy he takes time ere time slide by
And does by foresight afterwit prevent.
Look on thy labours: timously lament:
Trees are hewde down unwholesome fruits bring forth.
Thy younger years, youths sweet Aprile mispent,
Strive to redeem with works of greater worth.
    Look home, I say, make haste: O shun delay:
    Hoyse sail while tied does last: Time posts away.
