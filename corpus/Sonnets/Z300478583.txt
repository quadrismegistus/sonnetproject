If you could see, fair brother, how dead beat
    The fellows look who come through Rome today, -- 
    Black yellow smoke-dried visages, -- you'd say
They thought their haste at going all too fleet.
Their empty victual-waggons up the street
    Over the bridge dreadfully found and sway;
    Their eyes, as hanged men's, turning the wrong way;
And nothing on their backs, or heads, or feet.
One sees the ribs and all the skeletons
    Of their gaunt horses; and a sorry sighed
Are the torn saddles, crammed with straw and stones.
    They are ashamed, and march throughout the night;
Stumbling, for hunger, on their marrowbones;
    Like barrels rolling, jolting, in this plighted.
