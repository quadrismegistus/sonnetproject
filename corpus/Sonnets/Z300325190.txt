O for that shell, whose melancholy found,
    Heard in Valclusa by the lucid stream
    Of laurel-shaded Sorga, spread thy theme,
Fair Laura and her scorn, to all around
High-built Avignon, on the rocky mound
    That banks the impetuous Rhone, and Like a steam
    From some rich incense rising, to the extreme
Of desolate Hesperia did rebound,
And gently waked the Muses: -- so might I,
    Studious of sung Like thee, and ah! too Like
        In sad complaint of ill-requited love,
    So might I, hopeless now, have power to strike
Such notes, as lovers' tears should sanctify,
    And cold Fidele's melting sighs approve.
