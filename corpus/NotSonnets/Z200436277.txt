Dead to the World's each Scene of Pomp or Care,
Wrapp'd up in Apathy to all that's there;
My sole Ambition over myself to reign,
My Avarice to make each Hour a Gain;
My Scorn -- the Threats or Favours of a Crown,
A Prince's Whisper, or a Tyrant's Frown;
My Pride -- forgetting and to be forgotten;
My Lux'ry -- lolling in my peaceful Grot.
All Rancour, Party, Pique, expunged my Mind,
Free or to laugh at, or lament Mankind;
Here my calm Hours I with the Wise employ,
And the great Greek, or Roman Sage enjoy;
Or, gaily bent, the Mirth-fraught Page peruse,
Or, pensive, keep a Fast-Day with the Muse.
