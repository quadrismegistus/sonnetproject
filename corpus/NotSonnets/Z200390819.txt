Death! I not blame thy subtlety
    In cutting off this Happy She:
Ne'r didst thou yet in thy black list enrol
        So fair a soul.
    Thy Envie snatched her hence, lest we
    By her example taught, should be
Immortaliz'd by virtue, and live still
        Against thy will.
    For hadst thou spared her yet awhile,
    And not prevented by this wile
Our grand design, thou'adst lost thy sting, and we
        Not feared thee.
    Coward thou didst by slow degrees
    Upon her Vital spirits cease,
