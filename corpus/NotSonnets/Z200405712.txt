Whilst all to Reason make such strong Pretence,
Impartial Reason, and superior Sense,
How few, my Lord, to her Decrees submit,
Who'd mend our Morals, or who'd from our Wit!
Conceit and Judgment work such different Ways,
What the weak Head should hide, the Heart betrays.

Tho' Truth unchanging, Like the Pole, is seen,
Such Mists and Vapours often rise between,
Such Rocks and Shelves, in fancied Forms appear,
When Pride looks out, and Passion's Arm would steer:
Affrighted Candour quits the Helm with Pain,
And Judgment points, and Virtue toils in vain.

Self-love, in Man, wise Nature's Purpose shows,
Springs in the Soul, and with his Reason grows;
