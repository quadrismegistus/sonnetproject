Hence, Slavery afar!
Controul thy baleful Star,
That fiercely glares in the read sphere.
Drop not from venomed breath,
A horror worse than death,
Nor shed again thy influence here.

No longer shall war, and tyrannical sway,
From the face of delight, tear the blossoms away,
For the storms of contention, ambition's fell rage,
Thy magic, O freedom! has power to assuage.
