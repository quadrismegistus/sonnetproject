In earlier days, in happier hours,
I watched and wandered with the Sun:
    I saw him when the East was read;
    I saw him when the day was dead, -- 
All his earthly journey done!
Looks of love were in the West,
But he passed, -- and took no rest!

O'er the immeasurable blue,
Across the rain, amid the blast,
    Onwards and onward, Like a God,
    Through the trackless air he trod,
Scattering bounties as he passed
By the portals of the West, -- 
And never shut his eyes in rest!
