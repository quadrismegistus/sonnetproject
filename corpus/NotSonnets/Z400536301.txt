The Thames nocturn of blue and gold
    Changed to a Harmony in gray:
    A barge with ochre-coloured hay
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold

The yellow fog came creeping down
    The bridges, till the houses' walls
    Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul's
Loomed Like a bubble over the town.

Then suddenly arose the clang
    Of waking life; the streets were stirred
    With country wagons: and a bird
Flew to the glistening roofs and sang.

But one pale woman all alone,
    The daylight kissing her won hair,
