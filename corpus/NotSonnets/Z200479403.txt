That late welny had drowned the world with rain:
Breakes with his brightness through that sable shroud

To greater loves then ere we could expect:
The wit o'man men weak unable wit,
Admires the power of Heaven in working it.

That hand which came unto us with a rod,
And took away our peace-preserving Queen:
