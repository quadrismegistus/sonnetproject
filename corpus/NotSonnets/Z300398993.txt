Hush! not a found! no whisper! no demur!
No restless motion -- no intrusive stir!
But with stayed presence and a quiet breath,
One solemn moment dedicate to Death!

For now no fancied Misery's bespeak
The panting bosom, and the wetted cheek;
No fabled Tempest, or dramatic wreck,
No Royal Sire washed from the mimic deck,
And dirged by Sea Nymphs to his briny grave!
Alas! deep, deep beneath the sullen wave,
His heart, once warm and throbbing as your own,
Now cold and senseless as the shingle stone;
His lips, so eloquent, choked up with sand;
The bright eye glazed, -- and the impressive hand,
