Instruct us, Lord! from day to day,
    To feel and understand
How kind and merciful always
    Is thy chastising hand:
May we such chastening ever prize,
And own the mercy it implies.

The sunshine to the flower may give
    The tints that charm the sighed,
But scentless would that floweret live
    If skies were always bright;
Dark clouds and showers its scent bestow,
And purest joy is born of woe.

He who each bitter cup rejects,
    No living spring shall quaff;
