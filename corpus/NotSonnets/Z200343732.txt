In de dead of night I sometime,
    Git to t'inkin' of de pass'
An' de days w'en slavery helt me
    In my misery -- ha'd and' fas'.
Dough de time was mighty tryin',
    In dese houahs somehow hit seem
Dat a brightah light come slippin'
    Thoo de kivahs of my dream.

An' my min' fu'gits de whuppins
    Draps de feah oh' block and' lash
An' flies straight to somep'n' joyful
    In a secon's lightnin' flash.
Den hit seems I see a vision
    Of a dearah long ago
