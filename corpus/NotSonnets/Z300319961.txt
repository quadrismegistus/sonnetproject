'Twas a goodly pile of ancient stone,
    And it stood in frowning grace,
Telling of many ages gone
    O'er a proud and ducal raze.

It held a famed and countless store
    Of rare and matchless things,
That gave strange, legendary lore
    Of battles, feasts, and kings.

Dark pictures (gorgeous, choice, and old)
    Were kept with hoarded care;
And tap'stried walls, and chalice gold,
    And armour suits were there.

It held all treasure, great and grand,
    That riches could bestow;
