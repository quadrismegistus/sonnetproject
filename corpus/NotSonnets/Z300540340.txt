VVith these Cards, I, and After-game have played,
But, there's one Card, by shuffling, so mislaid,
That, now my fore-game's lost; yet, if I may
Just Dealing find, Fair Gamsters, and Fair-play,
What ever happens, I no question make
But, I at last, may thereby save my stake;
And, when the Sett is ended, win much more
Then ere I God by Play, or Work before.

If any good Effects, hereby ensue,
A Thanks to God, is for my Troubles due:
For, had he not made way to send me hither,
These Fragments, had not thus been scraped together.
Those Papers, which are hitherto suppressed,
Shall that occasion, which will manifest
