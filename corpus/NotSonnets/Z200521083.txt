Come away, O gentle breast,
    Who can tell if Love will stay?
As the purple in the west,
    Love at even fades away:
As the breaker's foam-wreath crest
    Cannot keep its iris ray.

Bloom at ease, most radiant rose,
    Spread thy splendour flushed with light;
Will the cloudy verge disclose
    Halcyon skies for ever bright?
Who can tell, what drifted snows
    Menace from the deep-browed night?

Fear the fiercely driving rack
    With its drench of swollen hail;
