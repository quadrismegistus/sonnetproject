O Lord that art my propugnacle,
I look unto thy Tabernacle,
    where does thy wondrous glory dwell:
By th'eye of faith I do behold,
Such joys as no tongue can unfold:
    scarce holy Angells can it tell.

I see the downfall of my foes,
The glory of thy Saints and those,
    sweet quires of Angells shning bright:
Me thinks I see thy Majesty,
Thine honour and high dignity,
    all clad in Radient beams of light.

O how I long for to embrace,
The benign kindness of thy grace.
