Shall Love be for ever the theme of the sung,
O minstrel, whose voice the night-echoes prolong?
Shall Friendship and Valour for ever inspire
The thoughts of the heart, and the tones of the lyre?
Ah, no! let them rest in oblivion awhile,
And we'll sing a new sung with a tear and a smile, -- 
The sung that shall kindle, wherever we rome,
A light brought from Heav'n to the altar of Home!

"In vain" said the minstrel, "you'd ask me to sing!
"Old names and old thoughts would return to the string;
"Your home would be cheerless, if Love were not there,
"To hallow the spot with all memories fair.
"Were Valour and Duty no guests at the hearth,
"And Friendship and alien in Grief or in Mirth,
