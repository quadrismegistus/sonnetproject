Come rally, boys! Awake, Awake!
    Hear, old affection on you calling,
Your childhood's home appeal does make,
    On willing ears may it be falling!
She calls you from your busy care,
    To meet her in her pleasant places,
Her old regard again to share,
    And smiles from old familiar faces.

Each rock and haunt, remembered well,
    Will send its hundreds forth to meet you;
Joy's loudest note will widely swell,
    And ardent hearts expand to greet you.
And bell and gun and flame and tongue
    Will blend their notes in peal sonorous,
