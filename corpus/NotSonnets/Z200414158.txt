Heavens listen, Earth bear Witness, Time record
My heavy Grieffe, and Speedy help afford,
My soul half sunk in sad despair does faint,
I scarce have breath to sigh out my Complaint:
My moistened Eyes with weeping almost blind
And parched tongue whose Cries no pity find
Now worn with woaes and wroungs without relief
At last give over hope and yield to Grief.

Yet that the world may know my wretched Cace,
And where Tales run Trueth may at length take place,
To all good Christians, members of that head
[Side note: 1Kb]Whose Cause, and Churches privilege I plead,
And in whose presence here I do protest
To have no other aim but peace and rest,
