Past the hills that peep
Where the leaze is smiling,
On and on beguiling
Crisply-cropping sheep;
Under boughs of brushwood
Linking tree and tree
In a shade of lushwood,
    There caressed we!

Hemmed by city walls
That outshut the sunlight,
In a foggy Don light,
Where the footstep falls
With a pit-pat wearisome
In its cadency
