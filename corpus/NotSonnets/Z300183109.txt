My songs to fell, good sir!
    I prey you buy.
Here's one will win a lady's tears,
    Here's one will make her gay,
Here's one will charm your true love true
    Forever and a day;
Good sir, I prey you buy!
Oh, no, he will not buy.

My songs to fell, good sir!
    I prey you buy.
Here's one will win a lady's tears,
    Here's one will make her gay,
Here's one will charm your true love true
    Forever and a day;
