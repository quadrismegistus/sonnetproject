Unhappy Princes have in wealth no grace,
To see how soon there vices ping them under,
But run unruly, reckelesse of their raze,
Till at the length they make themselves a wonder.
When from aloft their traces fall a sunder,
There is no hope to hold aright the trace:
Fortuna once when she begins to thunder,
They cannot keep aloft that' Imperial place:
The Lady blind, so blindly makes them blunder.

Behold my hap, on whom the Romayne rout
With joy did gaze, when bloody slain I lay.
Here lies (quoth they) thrust thirty times throughout:
The monster vile, that beast Caligula,
Which did so many guiltless Romaynes slay.
