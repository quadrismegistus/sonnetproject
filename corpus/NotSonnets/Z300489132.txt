Beautiful Earth! O how can I refrain
    From falling down to worship thee? Behold,
Over the misty mountains springs amain
    The glorious Sun; his flaming locks unfold
Their gorgeous clusters, pouring over the plain
    Torrents of light. Hark! Chanticleer has tolled
His matin bell, and the lark's choral train
    Warble on high hosannas uncontrolled.

All nature worships thee, thou newborn day!
Blade, flower, and leaf, their dewy offerings pay
    Upon the shrine of incense-breathing earth;
Birds, flocks, and insects, chant their morning lay;
    Let me, too, join in the thanksgiving mirth,
And praise, through thee, the God that gave thee birth.
