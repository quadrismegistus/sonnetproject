How lonely is this spot! Deep silence reigns;
    For ceased has every human stir and found;
But Nature's voice is herd in gentle strains
    Which with a stilly noise float softly round.

Each leaf which quivers in those giant elms
    Falls audibly upon the listening ear
As if it came from distant spirit realms,
    A warning of some death or danger near.

And now strange thoughts and mournful slowly rise
    Each after other in a gloomy train;
Each quickly born, and each as quickly die,
    Drunk by the whirlpool of oblivion's main.

But sudden, bursting from a thick, dark cloud,
    Lo! the bright sun illumines all the earth,
