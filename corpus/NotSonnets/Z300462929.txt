'Perish'd Adonis!' my full Sorrows sighs!
'Perish'd!' the Loves -- the weeping Loves reply!
Rise, hapless Queen, thy purple Robes forego -- 
Leave thy gay Couch, and snatch the Weeds of Woe!
Beat -- beat thy Breast, and tell: 'Tho' fair he shone,
'Alas, Adonis, though' so fair, is gone!'

'Perish'd, Adonis!' my full Sorrows sighs!
'Perish'd!' the Loves -- the weeping Loves reply!
I see his Thigh in weltering Horror bore,
The Wound all open to the Mountain-Air.
He breathes! Yet -- yet his Eyes a pale Mist dims,
As the black Crimson stains his snowy Limbs:
Lo! from his Lips the rosy Color flies,
And even thy soothing Kiss, O Venus, die!
