Since first over crested foam our sun's fire flashed to thee,
Never yet was come a call to such fortune fair and high;
Through a storm of strife it cried that thy share of life and crown
Thou shouldst win thee, Ireland, with long, with loved renown,
Fast leagued with all the Nations of the Free,
Where to have fought is fame, and glory it is to die.

Thy true sons, harkening, left thee full many a hero's name.
These all thou hast clean forgotten; by evil arts misled
To thy bitter woe hast followed, strayed from ancient honour afar,
Basest foes whose steps defile the bloodstained ways of war -- 
My heart's grief, Ireland! this bides ever thy shame
That thy faith thou hast broken, and hast betrayed thy Dead.

    It was not to be then, Ireland, soothly never to be.
Thou hast slave the hope, and now as from a face grown still and white
