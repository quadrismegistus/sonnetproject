Is there a bitter pang for love removed,
    Oh God! The dead love does not cost more tears
Than the alive, the loving, the beloved -- 
    Not yet, not yet beyond all Hope's and fears!
        Would I were laid
        Under the shade
Of the calm grave, and the long grass of years, -- 

That love might die with sorrow: -- I am sorrow;
    And she, that loves me tenderest, does press
Most poison from my cruel lips, and borrow
    Only new anguish from the old caress;
        Oh, this world's grief,
        Hath no relief,
In being wrung from a great happiness.
