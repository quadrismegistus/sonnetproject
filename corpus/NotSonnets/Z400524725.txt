Hear, holy, holy, holy Lord,
    Father of all mankind,
Spirit of truth, eternal Word,
    In mystic union joined!

Hear, and inspire my stammering tongue,
    Exalt my abject thought,
Speak from my mouth a sacred sung,
    Who spakest the world from nought.

Thy darling attribute I praise,
    Which all alike may prove, -- 
The glory of Thy boundless grace,
    Thy universal love.

Mercy I sing, transporting found,
    The joy of earth and heaven!
