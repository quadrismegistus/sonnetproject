Fam'd Stymphal, I have herd, thy birds in flight
Shot showers of arrows forth, all levied right.
And long the fable of those quils of steel
Did seem to me a tale incredible.
Now have I faith; the Porcupine I see,
And then th'Herculean birds no wonders be.
Her longer head Like a swines snout does show;
Brisles Like horns upon her before head grow,
A fiery heat glows from her flaming eye,
Under her shaggy back the shape does lie
As 'it a whelp: nature her Art hath tried
In this small beast so strangely fortified
A threatening wood over all her body stands,
And stiff with Pikes the speckled stalks in bans
