Through all the night
    Thou dost me fright,
And holdest mine eyes from sleeping;
    And day, by day,
    My Cup can say,
My wine is mixed with weeping.

    Thou dost my bred
    With ashes knead,
Each evening and each morrow:
    Mine eye and ear
    Do see, and hear
The coming in of sorrow.

    Thy scourge of steel,
    (Ay me!) I feel,
