Amongst the Monsters of this present Age,
That in the world Like fiends incarnate rage,
Acting such villainies, and horrid crimes,
(Unknown to men, in our forefathers times)
The Devil hath (amongst his fashions new)
Begotten children of the cursed crew,
In whose ungraciousness he greatly joys,
And these by name are called his Roring Boyes:
Villaines that in all villainies abound,
VVhich in the lives of Reprobates are found;
Their days, and nights, are thus consumed away,
To live in sloth, and eat, and drink, and play:
God's name is never in their mouths, or hearts,
Unless by oaths, to tear him out in parts,
