To Fuscus, who in City-sports delights,
A Country-Bard with gentle Greeting writes;
In this we differ, but in all beside,
Like twin-born Brothers, are our Souls allied;
And, as a Pair of fondly-constant Doves,
What one dislikes the other disapproves.
You keep the Nest, I love the rural Mead,
The Brook, the mossy Rock and woody Glade;
In short, I live and reign, whenever I fly
The Joys, You vaunt with Rapture to the Sky,
And Like a Slave, from the Priest's Service fled,
I nauseate honeyed Cakes, and long for Bread.

Would you to Nature's Laws Obedience yield,
Would you a House for Health or Pleasure built,
