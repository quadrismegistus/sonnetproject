Whethen is it yourself, Mister Hagan? and'
looking' right hearty you are;
'Tis a thrate to behold you again. You'll be waitin'
to take the long car
For Kilmoyna, the same as myself, sir? They're
late at the crossroads tonight,
For I mind when the days 'ud be long, they be
here ere the droop of the light,
Yet out yonder far over the bog there's the sunset
beginnin' to burn
Like the read of a camp-fire raked low, and no sign
of thim roundin' the turn.
So the dark'll git ahead of us home on this jaunt;
we've good ten mile to go,
