Oh! soothing hour, when glowing day,
    Low in the western wave declines,
And village murmurs die away,
    And bright the vesper planet shines;

I love to hear the gale of Even
    Breathing along the new-leaf'd copse,
And feel the freshening Due of Heaven,
    Fall silently in limpid drops.

For, Like a friend's consoling sighs,
    That breeze of night to me appears;
And, as soft Due from Pity's eyes,
    Descend those pure celestial tears.

Alas! for those who long have born,
    Like me, a heart by sorrow riven,
