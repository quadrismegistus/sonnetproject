"Then when the busy tedious Dream is over,
"We sink into the Grave, and are no more;
"And is then Death our Slumber? our Repose?
"Oh! when shall Death JOB's wearied Eye-lids close!
"As with desiring Eyes the harassed Swain,
"Expects the Evening-shade to quit the Plain;
"So with Impatience to the Grave I bend,
"And long to see my numerous Sorrows end:
"Not more solicitous the labouring Hind
"Is, that his Cares their Recompence may find,
