I have oft wondered why thou didst elect
Thy Mistress of a stuff none could affect,
That wore his eyes in the right place. A thing
Made up, when Natures powers lay slumbering.
One, where all pregnant imperfections met
To make her sexes scandal: Teeth of jet,
Hair died in Orpment, from whose fretful hew
Canidia her highest Witch-crafts drew.
A lip most thin and pale, but such a mouth
Which Like the Poles is stretched North and South.
A face so coloured, and of such a from,
As might defiance bid unto a storm:
And the complexion of her sallow hide
Like a wracked body washed up by the Tide:
