Care-charming sleep, thou son of sable Night,
That cheers our drooping spirits with delight;
Making us forget care, as if kept under
By some sweet spell, or some Lethean slumber,
Away and leave me: Thee I brook not well,
"Sorrow best fits with a Cloudie cell.
And what more cloudy, then where Sun never shone,
Where nought keeps Concord but continued moan,
Where sighs of Lovers, Passions of the mind,
Are all the Guests, that you are Like to find?
Poor blubbered Soul, is grief in her extent?
Or is your source of tears already spent?
Affliction works distraction! aye me then,
That feels the most, yet shows the least of men.
