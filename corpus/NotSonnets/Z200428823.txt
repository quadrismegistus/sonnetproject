A wake to praise, my Soul, and sing
The Mercies of that' eternal King:
O deep throughout thine inmost frame
Bless, bless the great Jehovab's Name;
Nor cease with studious thought to trace
The Acts of that stupendous Grace,
That blots from Heav'n's record thy sin,
That, while thy passion war within,
Assuasive calms their furious strife,
And rescues from the pit thy life;
Bids countless blessings round thee rife;
Thy every wish with Good supplies;
Thy years renews in their decline;
And makes the Eagle's vigour thine,
