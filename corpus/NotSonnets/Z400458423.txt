'OH, whither, whither ridest thou, Sir Erwin?
The glitter of the dawn is in the sky;
    And I hear the laverock singing,
    Where the silken corn is springing
And the green-and-gold of summer's on the rye.'

'O lady fair, I ride towards the setting;
For the glamour of the West is on my heart
    And I hear a dream-voice calling
    To the land where dews are falling
And the blossoms of the Springtide never depart.'

'Oh, what, o, what thing seekest thou, Sir Erwin?
Is life no longer pleasant to thy soul?
    Am I no more heart's dearest,
    Though the summer skies are clearest
