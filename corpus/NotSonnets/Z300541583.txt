Now, Joan, we are married -- and now, let me say,
Tho' both are in youth, yet that youth will decay,
In our journey through' life, my dear Joan, I suppose
We shall oft meet a bramble, and sometime a rose.

When a cloud on this forehead shall darken my day,
Thy sunshine of sweetness must smile it away;
And when the dull vapour shall dwell upon thine.
To chase it, the labour and triumph be mine.

Let us wish not for wealth, to devour and consume;
For luxury's but a short road to the tomb:
Let us sighs not for grandeur, for trust me, my Joan,
The keenest of cares owes its birth to a throne.

Thou shalt milk our one cow; and if Fortune pursue,
In good time; with her blessing, my Joan may milk two:
