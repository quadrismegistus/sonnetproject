Why dost thou heap up Wealth, which thou must quit,
    Or, what is worse, be left by it?
Why dost thou load thy self, when thou.'rt to fly,
    Oh Man ordained to die?

Why dost thou built up stately Rooms on high,
    Thou who art under Ground to lie?
Thou Sow'st and Plantest, but no Fruit must see,
    For Death, alas! is sowing Thee.

Suppose, thou Fortune couldst to tameness bring,
    And clip or pinion her wing;
Suppose thou couldst on Fate so far prevail
    As not to cut off thy Entail.

Yet Death at all that subtlety will laugh,
    Death will that foolish Gardner mock,
