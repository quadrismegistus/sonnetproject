Progress ever! Pure and holy shines the light of morning, slowly
    Brightening all that seemed so evil, changing sad things into sweet!
Man the victor, man the giant, lord of all things, self-reliant,
    Shall be crowned with golden sunshine, darkness trembling at his feet.

But the vanquished? What of roses that the summer morn discloses
    Lying pale and bruised and sodden in the miry heedless way?
What of violets in the hollows that no sunshine guards and follows,
    Lying loveless, doomed and helpless, trodden slowly into clay?

One succeeds -- a thousand falter. One to marriage's white altar
    Brings in triumph sweet and solemn the pure footstep of his bride.
With her wedding-robe around her, lo! what angel-hands have crowned her:
    All the summer brings its lilies, all is joy and peace and pride.

But another, even fairer, with a wealth of passion rarer,
    Lovelier far, it may be, hidden in the soul's depths dark and lone,
