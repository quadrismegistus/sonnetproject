Man asks homage. When his foot does stand
On earth's high places, he exacteth fear
From those who serve him. His proud spirit loves
The quick observance of and abject eye
And cowering brow. His dignity he deems,
Demands such aliment, -- and he does show
Its evanescence, by the food he seeks
To give it nutriment. Yea, more than this -- 
He over his brother rules, with scourge and chain,
Treading our Nature's charities, till life
To madness tortured, or in misery crushed,
Goes, and accusing spirit, back to God.
 -- But He, the Eternal Ruler, wills not
The slavery of the soul. His claim is love,
