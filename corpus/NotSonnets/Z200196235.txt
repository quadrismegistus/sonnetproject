Be wreaths of glory for the hero's name;
August his deeds and sacred be his fame;
But flowers of rich perfume shall deck the grave
Of him who lived to succour and to save.
And Cassia's blossoms twine with Sharon's rose
Where our dear brother's relics now repose.

Thy Memory, O Warren, will ever be dear,
    Whilst any the sense of thy virtue retains,
Fraternal affection with gratitude's tear,
    Shall blend on the marble that shrouds thy remains.
For bright as the arch that through heaven extends,
    Was the genius that flashed from thy luminous mind,
And soft as the Due on the dry earth descends,
    Was the pity that led thee to succour mankind.
