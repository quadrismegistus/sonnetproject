Blessed Infant to thy Marble I am sent
By pitying fate and my own discontent,
To be resolved, why (in thy budding youth)
Thou were thus rudely ravished, that the truth
Unto thy mourning friends I may relate,
Who with their tears thy cold urn consecrate.
How didst thou get thy ruin? what fate sent
Thy beauteous body to that element
Devoures those it embraceth? couldst thou be
Flatter'd to hug the infidelity
Of wanton Thetis? sure it was not so,
Twas thy own Beauty wrought thy overthrow;
She was enamored of thee, and could find
No way but this to sat her ravenous mind.
