It is August moonlight in the tall plantation,
Whose elms, by aged squirrels' footsteps worn,
    Outscreen the noon, and eve, and morn.
On the facing slope a faint irradiation
    From a mansion's marble front is born,
        Mute in its woodland wreathing.
    Up here the nightjar whirrs forlorn,
And the trees seem to withhold their softest breathing.

To the moonshade slips a woman in muslin vesture:
Her naked neck the gossamer-web besmears,
    And she sweeps it away with a hasty gesture
Again it touches her forehead, her neck, her ears,
        Her fingers, the backs of her hands.
        She sweeps it away again
