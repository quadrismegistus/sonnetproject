A few minutes passed noon:
the birds begin their evening songs
and break for the trees;
the horse nods in its dimming stall.
Afraid of a truth that could blind
I turn my cold shoulder to the sun
and catch its shadow in a cardboard box
as though it were some rare bug
about to be effaced by the moon's
slow thumb. To catalog is not enough.
What did Adam know, naming the apple?
What do the astronomers suspect?
The sun Like a swallowed sword
comes blazing back.
