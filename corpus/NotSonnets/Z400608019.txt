There are people there, beyond the Rockies
As there are people here, on this side.

But the people there, beyond the Rockies
Seem always to be asking, asking something.

The new moon sets at sundown,
And there, beyond the sunset, quivers.

An Indian, walking wrapped in his winding sheet
Answers the question as he puts it, in his stride.

Mexicans, Like people who have died
Ask, in the space of their eyes:
What have we lost?

What have we lost, in the west?
We who have gone west?
There is no answer.
