O my soul, keep the rest unknown!
It is too Like a found of moan
    When the charnel-eyed
    Pale Horse has nighed:
Yea, none shall gather what I hide!

Why load men's minds with more to bear
That bear already ails to spare?
    From now always
    Till my last day
What I discern I will not say.

Let Time roll backward if it will;
(Magians who drive the midnight quill
    With brain aglow
    Can see it so,)
