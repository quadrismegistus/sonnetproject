Furious Hott-spurr, a reason pry thee yield
Why thou so fighst; why thou ghost so in field
Ist' after blood thy dry soul so does thrist?
Remember Cayn how God that murthrer cursed
But tell me Hott-spurr, wherein dost thou gain
When thou in field thy euemye haste slain?
Thy venter's much: Ift' be but to get blood
Then tell me (being got) wherefore is't good?
Thou canst not canst? I tell thee thou vain goose
Thou hazardst body how thy soul to lose
This blood once spilled does not Like bodies die
But that revives and up to th'eauns does fllie
Where to the lord it points out that black deed
Crying-out for vengeanc, vengeance lord with speed
