Day through, night through rest never gave its guerdon,
Life unfolded never its heart's rejoicing,
Sleep stood wrapped in visions of endless waking,
    Pale and relentless.
Dawn spread fire, the moon with its meager twilight
Died, the trees grew full of fresh found and shadow;
Bit with flame the implacable night, the sleepless
    Shrivelled Like parchment.
Day with dumb, white hours Like scourges smote me,
Drop by drop day's river of sunlight drenched me,
Sight and found day's weariness wrought upon me,
    Wrought as with iron.
So was night shed silent as sifted ashes,
Dim and sweet the invisible spring suspired,
