Bury me deep, and dig me in -- it's all you have to do,
And set a stone that'll save my skin from the slinking jackal crew:
Plant me out where the paths divide, up on the edge of the thorn,
And tuck the rifle down at my side (the barrels are badly worn).

I reckon it may be good to know, when the worms have had their fill,
That the dear old 'phunts still come and go over the hump of the hill -- 
Dead as a nail, I'll bet I hear their thumping feet go by,
And the flogging tail, and the flapping ear between my bones and the sky.

Lonely, you think? a rum idea? That's for a man to say!
I've known this country many a year, and I came out here to stay;
I'ld rather be planted fair and free, with a beast or two around
Than in a suburban cemetery, next to the Underground.

'Twon't be so lonely, for a lot of niggers are bound to pass
Chasing a buck, as Like as not, skidding along in the grass --
