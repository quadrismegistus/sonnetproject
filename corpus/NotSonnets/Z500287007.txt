Hyppeas, your cloak I crave, that is my due,
Your stockings too, and such Like toys as these,
Free to bestow a Bountie were in you,
And yet a debt, for you do know my fee's.
But Debt to mention I do think't unfit,
When Bountie is so near to answer it.

And yet I want, and yet what can I want,
When He of whom I crave's so prove to give?
When store by Jove is sent, there is no scant,
All famine leave, and all in plenty live.
See what thou wants then Minthos, and but crave it,
Hyppeus is stored, and thou art sure to have it.

Belt, Beaver, Buskin, view from top to toe,
See what thou wants his Wardrope will supply,
