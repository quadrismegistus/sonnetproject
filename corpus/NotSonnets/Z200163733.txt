All the old sages, however indeed
    They wrangle and fight in the bitterest way,
In one thing, at least, are fully agreed:
    They wink at each other and laughingly say,
For the mending of fools it is foolish to wait,
Fools will be fools as certain as fate.
        Sons of Wisdom! make 'em your tools;
        That, only that, is the use of fools!

Merlin, the ancient, long in his shroud,
    Where I accosted him once in my youth,
Unto my questioning answered aloud,
    Solemnly speaking this notable truth:
For the mending of fools it is foolish to wait,
Fools will be fools as certain as fate.
