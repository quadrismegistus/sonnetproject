Adieu sweet Chloris, for the Fates deny
Me longer life and longer liberty.
I've lost the one in gazing on that face,
Which justly may ot'h Paphian Queen take place
To thee my liberty's refign'd the grave
Tomb shall bespeak me Chloris constant slave.
How can I longer think to live when I
Ravish'd from the clear Sunshine of thine eye
Feel chilling colds; and winter frosts begirt
Continually with fatal blasts my heart?
No 'this those beams, which thy bright eyes display
That must dispel, and chase these snows away,
That killing absence brings: nought butthy breath
May now redeem me from the dart of Death.
