Disrob'd by Sinne, exposed to the cold air,
    Of dire despair,
    I sigh I groan:
Famish'd for want of heavenly sustenance,
    My spirit faints,
    And is nigh gone.
My time, my prime, and patrimony I,
    Have made to fly,
    In foreign lands:
Lands far remote from new Jerusalem,
    Or Bethlehem,
    On cursed bans
Of Ruffians, Baudes, and whores: These Ruffians dire,
    Were wrath, and ire,
