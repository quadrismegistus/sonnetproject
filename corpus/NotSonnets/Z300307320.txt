Is it window or mirror the enormous
Deforming glass propped on horizons here?
What did we see? Some town pinched in a pass
Across which stares perpetual startled sheer
Vacuous day, the kind blind wilderness,
Space put behind bars, face pushed too near:

Painfully upright among lost hills
Bowed under cloud, made fast to the shocked ships
Locked in and eddy, dwelling. There, none wills
Redress or dreams it, or pondering some lapse
Out of a dream strays back into that town
A mirage of the cracked antarctic stole,
Or stumbles on the original dazed stone
Pitched out of Scotland to the opposite Pole.
