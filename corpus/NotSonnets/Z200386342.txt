Her Eyes were black spread flaming Rays
Which Diamonds could far outblaze;
Transcendent beams: fair Soul from thence
Did shine with glorious Form to Sense.
Two glist'rng Mints of Lightning were;
Choice beauty's Worlds; mysterious there;
In whose full Globes Night, Day entwined,
Both black and Fair at once combined,
Seem'd darker-veyl'd least else confounded
Mens view, destroyed, though sweetly wounded;
For Persons struck by that fair Eye,
Well pleased appeared still so to Die.
Such lovely fires withal beheld,
Faint Stars, Sun's gaudy Beams excelled.
