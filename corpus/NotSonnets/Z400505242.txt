Thus Luna's brother lower does descend,
And at the Archer rests his radiant Wain,
Now winter's bitter blasting storms contend,
T'assault our hemespheare, with might and main,
The fields and trees disrobed all again,
Stark naked striped of herbs, of flowers, of fruits,
And now the Lord, the Lowne, the Sir, the Swain,
Against the freeze, of Freeze make winter suits.
Now chirping birds are all turned tounglesse mutes;
And Shepherds swains to sheephouse driven their sheep.
Not controversies now are in disputes
At Westminster, where such a coil they keep;
Where man does man within the Law betosse,
Till some go croslesse home by Woodcocks Cross.
