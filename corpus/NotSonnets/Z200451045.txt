The songs of Nature, holiest, best are they!
    The sad winds sighing through the leafy trees -- 
    The lone lake's murmurs to the mountain breeze -- 
The streams' soft whispers, as they fondly stray
    Through dingles wild and over flowery leas,
    Are sweetly holy; but the purest hymn -- 
A melody Like some old prophet-lay -- 
    Is thine, poured forth from hedge, and thicket dim -- 
        Linnet! wild Linnet!

The poor, the scorned and lowly, forth may go
    Into the woods and dells, where leaves are green;
    And 'mong the breathing forest flowers may lean,
And hear thy music wandering to and from,
    Like sunshine glancing over the summer scene.
