Since, to please the gay world, all our fashions must be
Adjusted and set -- a la mode de Paris;
I'll sing you, my comrades, un petit chanson,
Just imported from Paris -- "Ill faut de l'argent."
The truth of my ditty all stations must own,
From the churl at his plough, to the king on his throne.
Great George to his Commons is wont to repeat
The success of his envoys, his armies and fleet:
He laments that new burdens must still be laid on,
And concludes a fine speech with -- "Ill faut de l'argent."
Put spur to Pegasus, and take a fair start,
To the humbler of kings, the sublime Bonaparte:
He darts through the nations, unrivets their chains,
Sets their tyrants adrift, and gives freedom the reins;
