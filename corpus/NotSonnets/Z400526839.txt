Holy, holy, holy Lord,
        Mysterious One in Three,
    Must I perish unrestored,
        Through ignorance of Thee?
    Still a dying sinner spare,
Till Thou from all my sins release:
    Triune God, regard my prayer,
        And bid me die in peace.

    In a dreary vale of woe
        I long have lived in pain,
    Followed on the Lord to know,
        But followed on in vain:
    Still, alas, I know not where
To find Thee whom my lips confess:
