At last he seemed to loose it altogether
    Upon the Mississippi; where he stayed
His course at Memphis, undecided whither
    He should go back or forward. Here he strayed
    One afternoon along the esplanade
And high bluff of the river-fronting town,
To watch the boats and see the sun go down.

The lyric fit had left him; but the sighed
    Of the strong river sweeping vast and slow,
Gleaming far off, a flood of crimson light;
    And, darkly hung between it and the glow
    Of a most lovely sunset sky, the low,
Interminable forests of Arkansas,
Might have inspired some very pretty stanzas.
