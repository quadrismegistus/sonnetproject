The mountaintop stands in silence a minute after the murder.
The women are furies racing down the slope;    far down,
copper and black of hair, the white heel running, escaped line
of skirt and foot,
among the leaves and needles of these witness trees.  Overhead,
clouds, lions and towers of the sky.
Darkness masses among the treetops;  dense shapes bulk among
treetops over the murdered ground, stain of light glancing on the jointed branches.
Light of water, blaze of the comet-tailed stars.
The scene is the mountain, just after the murder, with a dry concentrated moon
rocking back and forth between the crowns of trees, back and forth, until over this black crown,
attacking the sharp black and the secrecy, moon comes to rest.
And the exhausted
women are streaming down the paths at the foot of the mountain,
