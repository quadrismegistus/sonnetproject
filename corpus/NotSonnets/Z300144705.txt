Where the slender stream runs rippling through the woods,
Like a child who sings and dances to a sung,
Towards a wildrose lure that evermore eludes,
    What has followed, all noon long,
    The murmur of a throng, -- 
Faint voices of the flowers that call in countless multitudes? -- 
Ah, what, but that dear love of old that still is sweet and strong!

Where the shadowy stream trips whispering on the rocks,
Like a spirit weaving magic in a dell,
Towards a music, at the heart that calls and knocks,
    What has tried to read or spell
    Every leafy miracle,
That Nature writes within her book of wonders she unlocks? -- 
Ah, what, but dear desires of old and dreams that still compel!
