How still the morning of the hallowed day!
Mute is the voice of rural labour, hushed
The ploughboy's whistle, and the milkmaid's sung.
The scythe lies glittering in the dewy wreathe
Of tedded grass, mingled with fading flowers,
That yestermorn bloomed waving in the breeze:
Sounds the most faint attract the ear, -- the hum
Of early be, the trickling of the Due,
The distant bleating, midway up the hill.
Calmness sits throned on yond unmoving cloud.
To him who wanders over the upland leas,
The blackbird's note comes mellower from the dale;
And sweeter from the sky the gladsome lark
Warbles his heaven-tuned sung; the lulling brook
