Did Tagus flow beside my cot,
        And warble soft over bed of gold,
        Were I by whispering zephyr told,
    That I should, in some favoured spot,
Hear notes so pleasing, thither would I flee,
Nor warbling Tagus heed, to listen, fair, to thee.

    For me did blessed Arabia's grove
        Each sense-subduing sweet distil,
        And soft melodious numbers fill
    My ravished ear with notes of love,
That charm of numbers should not bind me long;
That charm, fair, would I break, to listen to thy sung.

    Thus in a summer's gaudy day,
        Oft have I herd a sportive train,
