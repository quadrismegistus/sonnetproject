O Muse, awake the Olympic Lay,
Which to Archestratus' brave Son we owe;
The meed I promised to bestow,
Oblivion's icy hand had wiped away:
And thou, O Truth, the favourite Maid
Of thundering Jove, vouchsafe thy aid
To quell their slanderous falsehoods, who pretend
I ever with wilful aim deceived a trusting Friend.
Full many and hour has rolled away
Since shame has made my cheeks with crimson glow,
So long the promised meed to owe:
But now the sung, with interest, I'll repay;
And, as where Ocean's billows roar,
They clear from stain the pebble shore,
