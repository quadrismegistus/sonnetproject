Gen
little frown
buried in her breast
and long black hair
Gen for milk
Gen for sleep
Gen for looking-over-shoulder
far beyond the waving eucalyptus
limbs and farther dreaming crow
flying slow and steady for the ocean;
eyes over drippy nipple
at the rising shadow sun
whale's of cool and dark,
Gen patted-on-the-head by Kai,
