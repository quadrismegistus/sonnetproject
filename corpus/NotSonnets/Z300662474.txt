When the mistress is the master,
    The gray mare's the better horse:
The old proverb sticks the faster,
    Since its claws are rather coarse.

'Tis the burden of the ballad
    I am now about to sing;
Just the sauce, to give the salad,
    Its due piquancy and sting.

Let the text of my brief sermon
    Warn away all ears polite;
Here distil no dews of Hermon,
    Coals of juniper burn bright.

On a raw December morning,
    While my friends were snug in bed,
