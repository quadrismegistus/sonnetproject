Morpheus the humble God, that dwells
In cottages and smoky cells,
Hates gilded roofs and beds of down;
And though he fears no Princes frown,
Flies from the circle of a Crown.

Come, I say, thou powerful God,
And thy Leaden charming Rod,
Dipt in the Leth√¶an Lake,
Ore his wakeful temples shake,
Lest he should sleep and never wake.

Nature (alas) why art thou so
Obliged to thy greatest Foe?
Sleep that is thy best repast,
Yet of death it bears a taste,
