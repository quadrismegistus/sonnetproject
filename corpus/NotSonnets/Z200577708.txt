Is there no bound of blood to you, my brother?
Who have called her ours, the ancient Mother,
And here we hope to rest from Life's temptation
Building of souls our patriotic Nation.

Can we not stand amongst the purple heather
To find that God we both revere together?
Beneath this sky can come no bigot preaching
To fling our lofty dreams to lowly teaching.

William or James, needs we still hate each other
For their dead sakes, my Irish-hearted brother?
Can we not prey without fear of dissension
"God save our land" with but the same intention?

If we from Derry walls were flung defeated,
And you from Limerick town in speed retreated,
