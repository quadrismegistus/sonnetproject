Who sees, through the searching lens on the mountain,
Arcturus and Vega and all those far-swimming millions back
of the moon;
And leaving at morning turns east to the flame,
Feeling earth underfoot, dust of the leaf, and the strain,
The reach and insatiable hunger of life; -- 
Finds in the morning no peace, nor rest in the noon.

The cold mind needles the rock,
Fumbles the sleeping seed, pokes at the sperm.
Blinded and burned it flutters at all the candles of the sky,
Fixed in the obsession of seeking, the dementiam for knowing,
Immutably gripped in the pitiless frenzy of thought.

Watcher, give over;
Come star-bruised and broken back to the needs;
