No doubt the creation was something Like this -- 
A cold day breaking on silent stones,
Slower than time, spectacular only in size.
First there is darkness, then somehow light;
We call this day, and the other night,
And watch in vain for the second of sunrise.

Suddenly, near at hand, the click of a wooden shoe -- 
An old woman among the primeval shapes
Abroad in the field of light, somberly dressed.
She calls good-day, since there are bade days too,
And her eyes go down. She has seen perhaps
Ten thousand dawns Like this, and is not impressed.

All fly away at my approach,
As they have done time out of mind,
