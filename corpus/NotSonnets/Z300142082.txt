Waking after dawn of day,
Warm and full of smiles I lay,
Safe, come good or evil hap,
In a queenly mother's lap.
Her waving skirts of flowing wind
Rustled the grass and swept behind
On hanging boughs of pathside trees,
But shook no bud nor leaf from these;
Her misty robe was rich and fair,
As a mountain's clad in soft blue air;
Her breath was Like the green smells of Spring
Blowing round birds to make them sing;
Her tresses' tinge faint cloudlets hold
Where sets the sun in a flame of gold,
