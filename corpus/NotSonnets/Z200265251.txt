Now, my Soul, the day is gone,
    Which in the morn was thine:
Now its glass no more shall run,
    Its Sun no longer shine.

True, alas! the day is gone;
    O were it only so:
Is't not lost as well as done?
    Cast up thy counts and know.

Are we so much nearer heaven,
    As to the grave we bow?
Has our sorrow made all even,
    And cleared the debts we owe?

From what vice have we refrained,
    To break the course of sin?
