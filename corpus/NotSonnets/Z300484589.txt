O health, capricious maid!
Why dost thou shun my peaceful bower,
Where I had hope to share thy power,
    And bless thy lasting aid?

    Since thou, alas! art flown,
It 'vails not whither muse or grace,
With tempting smile, frequent the place:
    I sighs for thee alone.

    Age not forbids thy stay;
Thou yet mightest act the friendly part;
Thou yet mightest raise this languid heart;
    Why speed so swift away?

    Thou scornest the city-air;
I breathe fresh gales over furrowed ground,
