After the summer glory has departed,
    After the sun slides low down the skies,
After each snowy rose, and the red-hearted,
    Droops in the chilling blast, and faints, and die,
When the brown be no longer seeks the clover,
    But flies away, and hides in his honeyed den,
And from the bleak hills cutting winds blow over,
    Full of keen darts -- ah, will you love me then?

Or is it but the passion heat of Summer,
    That you mistake for love within your heart?
And will not Winter, that unwelcome comer,
    With his cold, scornful sneers, make it depart?
Have not the subtle odours of the flowers
    Drugged you, and made you drunk with rare perfumes?
