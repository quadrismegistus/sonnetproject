Silence no more my lonely Spirit grieves;
The Cusipata's Art my Tongue relieves;
The Bar's removed that heightened my Distress,
And Perseverance meets the wished Success;
I'm so proficient in this Language grown,
'Twill soon become familiar as my own:
Even now, attentive, I can comprehend
The Conversation of my pious Friend.
From him I learn, that, in the dreadful Hour,
When my Soul trembled at the Thunder's Roar,
Even then, my Fate was kind, when least I thought,
And the first Means of my Redemption wrought;
That France (the Kingdom where I now reside)
Had sent its Force to curb the Spanish Pride;
