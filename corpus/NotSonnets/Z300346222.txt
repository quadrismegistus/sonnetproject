They stood on the deck of the slave-freighted bark,
All hopeless, all dying, while waited the shark;
Sons, Fathers, and Mothers, who shrieked as they pressed
The infants that pined till they died on the breast -- 
A crowd of sad mourners, who sighed to the gale,
While on all their dark faces the darkness grew pale.

White demons beheld them, with curse and with frown,
And cursed them, from morn till the darkness came down;
And knew not compassion, but laughed at their prayer,
When they called on their God, or wept loud in despair;
Till again rose the morn, and all hushed was the wail,
And on cheeks stark and cold the grim darkness was pale.

Then the white heartless demons, with curse and with frown,
Gave the dead to the deep, till the darkness came down:
