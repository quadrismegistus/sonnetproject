Almighty Father! Thou Creator! God!
Whose works are wise and infinite, and good;
Thou, who hast called the universe from nought,
Whose Majesty, is spread from World to World,
Whose sons of old did worship Thee Supreme,
In law of deep humility and love;
Hear thou thy Church; our humble voices hear.

We call Thee Father, for we own no Lord
Creator, but the wisdom of thy Word.
Our Father who in Heaven dost preside
The only God, Omnipotent and good;
Thy sacred name Jehovah, be revered.
In purest thought thy Majesty be known
And sanctified, upon the souls of men.
