This creature, though extremely thin,
    In shape is almost square;
Has many heads, on which never grew
    One single lock of hair.

Yet several of their tribe there are,
    Whose case you must bewail,
Of whom in truth it may be said
    They 'we neither head nor tail.

In purer times, ere vice prevailed,
    They met with due regard,
The wholesome counsels that they gave,
    With reverence were herd.

To marriages and funerals
    Their presence added grace,
