VVhen gaudy Flora in her prime
Observing it was Summer-time
With fragrant flowers of each day
Had made our mother Tellus gay,
The new born plumed minstrels fills
The smiling heaven and echoing hills,
With chirping music, every groan
Was made their choir. -- Olympick Iove
Commanded Aprels balmy showers,
To refresh the March bred flowers,
And May perfection in each field
To Aprils suckling babes to yield.
The spring perfumed this brood, whose smell
The Phenix nest might parallel.
