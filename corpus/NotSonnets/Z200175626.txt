This my last Labour, gentle Goddess, aid,
To Worthy due, by Flavia hapless made;
Be such the Song, that she the Bard approve,
And listen to the honest Planter's Love.
To Worthy who their Measures can refuse?
The best in Maryland deserves the Muse.
So shall thy Bard acknowledge still thy Sway,
And when thou biddest the Song, attune the Lay.
Begin -- his generous Passion let us sing,
While warbling Mock-Birds usher in the Spring
Nor think the cheerful, spritely Labour vain
The waving Woods will echo back the Strain!

What Groves, my jolly Girls, your forms conceal,
When Worthy burns with Love, without Avail?
