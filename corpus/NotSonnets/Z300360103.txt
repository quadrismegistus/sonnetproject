What is consciousness that it
Leaves us when most we needs it
To save what little we have
Managed to construct? Will the
Pale torch of loving soon be
Sputtering out for me? The
Children joke at table whither
Grandfather should be buried
Or burned. What difference
Could it make? Does their humour
Mask any affection that will
Last when life takes them by
Their little necks and shakes
Them as it can, rich or poor?
