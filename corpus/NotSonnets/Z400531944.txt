While the' afflicted people weep
    Hardly let their pastor go,
Can he still his distance keep,
    No humane emotions know,
Haughty gravity maintain,
Scorn to share the parting pain?

He who knew a father's mind
    Must perceive his bowels move,
Must his children's weakness find,
    All the tokens of their love
Kindly, cordially receive,
Mix his tears with them that grieve.

Tears of saints! how can it be?
    Saints rejoicing evermore,
