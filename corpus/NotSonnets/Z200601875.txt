the moon now
woos the forum
with old smooth oratories
cool silver rhetoric
of silence

"my pale curve
closes the bracket
of all littleness, humanity) beyond are
only the long, sleek, porpoise-
phases of infinity"

        slowly circling
        shadows
        people thinly
        this nocturnal day
