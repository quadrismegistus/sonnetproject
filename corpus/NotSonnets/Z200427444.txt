Thy daughter calls; Argantyr, break
The bonds of death; she calls, awake.
Reach me forth the tempered blade,
Beneath thy marble pillow laid;
Which once a sceptered warrior boar,

Blasted by the thunder's stroke,
Arise, arise, you men of blood,
Ye who prepared the Vulture's food;
Give me the sword, and studded belt;
Armies whole their force have felt:
