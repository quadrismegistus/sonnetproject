Farrah! [Footnote 1: 2Kb] -- What is that thundering found that rolls over Liffey's plain,
And yond young lion, who is he, that shakes his shaggy mane?
That lion brave, whose fierce loud growl makes Irish hearts rejoice,
And fills the Saxon churls with awe at that' echo of his voice.
What is that fire that smouldering lies, whose blaze the Saxons fear,
Who light's Ierna's son to fame -- the star of rough Kildare?
'Tis noble Gerald's valiant son, the top branch of the oak,
That long has shaded Liffey's banks, nor fears the lightning's stroke.

'Tis Thomas of the vest of silk, the raven of the vale,
The falcon of Kildare's tall towers, that scorns the mountain gale,
The raked-up ember whose fierce flame shall prove the overthrow
Of every hungry Saxon dog -- then "Farrah Crom-aboo."
'Tis Thomas of the iron shirt -- he doffs his silken vest,
As flies the bright steel from its sheath, the war spear from its rest;
