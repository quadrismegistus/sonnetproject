Peace, moaning Sea; what tale have you to tell?
    What mystic tidings, all unknown before?
    Whether you break in thunder on the shore,
Or whisper Like the voice within the shell,
O moaning Sea, I know your burden well.

'Tis but the old dull tale, filled full of pain;
    The finger on the dial-plate of time,
    Advancing slow with pitiless beat sublime,
As stoops the day upon the fading plain;
And that has been which may not be again.

The voice of yearning, deep but scarce expressed,
    For something which is not, but may be yet;
    Too full of sad continuance to forget,
Too troubled with desires to be at rest,
