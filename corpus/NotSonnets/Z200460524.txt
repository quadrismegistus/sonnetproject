Musing as I walked alone,
What to think, or think upon,
    This idea struck my mind:
Where and what am I doing,
Does it tend to peace or ruin?
    To inform me be so kind.

"What!" says something Like and elf,
"Can you not inform yourself?
    "Who's obliged to answer you?"
Nobody that I can tell;
Yet I could but take it well,
    And my gratitude would show.

But at length I hear a voice,
That, without complaint or noise,
