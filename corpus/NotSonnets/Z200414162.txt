The lonely Lysis, whom a froward Fate
Full Twenty Summers in a sober State,
Had seen a Stranger to his Native Soil,
In Foreign Fields, worn with the weary Toil
Of wandering, waiting on a wayward Flock
Which neither hoised his Hope's, nor swelled his Stock;
One Day went pensive over a pleasant Plain,
Near where old Maes does fall into the Main:
His Heart was heavy, and he knew not why,
His Lambs did bleeting go, the surly Sky
Seem'd to presage a Storm, which to prevent
Unto his old Retreat he swiftly went.
An Aged Elm there was, whose spreading Arms
Had sheltered him from many Showers and Storms,
