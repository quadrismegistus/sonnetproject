The bruise is not there,
Nor the bullying boy,
Nor the girl who gave him the bitter gift,
Under the haws in the hollow dark and the windless air;
But the rue remains,
The rue remains in the delicate echo of what was done;
And he who labors above the lines
Leans to and ache as old almost
As the howl that shook him in his own birth,
As the heavy blow that beat him to breath
When the womb had widened.

For boyhood bent him:
Awkward at games he limped in the offing.
Youth yoked him:
