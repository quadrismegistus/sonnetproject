Go, gentle Oriana, go,
    Thou seest the Gods will have it so;
    Alas! Alas! 'this much in vain
    Of their ill usage to complain,
    To curse them when we want relief,
    Lessens our courage, not our grief:
    Dear Oriana, wipe thine Eye,
    The Time may come, that thou, and I
Shall meet again, long, long to prove
What Vigour absence adds to love,
Smile Oriana then, and let me see,
That look again, which stole my liberty.

    But say that Oriana die,
    And that sad moment may be nigh;
