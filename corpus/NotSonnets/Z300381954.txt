A bottom for your silk it seems
    my letters are become,
Whiche with oft winding off and on
    are wasted whole and some.
Who nilling other for to find
    but through my painting pen,
Thereto to give occasion
    to write you will not lenne.
And sith you take such great delight
    my bottoms for to spend,
Beholde now granting to your will,
    and other here I send.
Ne suitor ultra crepidam,
    I give this phrase to view,
