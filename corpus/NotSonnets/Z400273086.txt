Come swain assume thy slighted pipe, and play
Upon thy oaten reed a roundelay,
Come warble amorous anthems, call to be
Partakers in thy mirth the Napææ,
That haunt arbusted groves, those rural powers
That live enshrined in oaken curled bowers,
Among the sapplins tall, whose shady roof
Are ringletts knit of branching elm, star proof,
Call Natades from their obscure fluse
By which his Alpheus met his Arethuse,
Call mountain Orcades for to comply
To further with us this solemnity,
Call the thrice three sweet Aganipian Nymphs
That keeps the fancy in Heliconian lymphs
