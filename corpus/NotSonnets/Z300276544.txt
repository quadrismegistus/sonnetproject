One day the Amorous Lysander,
    By and impatient Passion swayed,
    Surpriz'd fair Cloris, that loved Maid,
    Who could defend her self no longer.
    All things did with his Love conspire;
    The gilded Planet of the Day,
    In his gay Chariot drawn by Fire,
    Was now descending to the Sea,
    And left no Light to guide the VVorld,
But what from Cloris Brighter Eyes was hurled.

    In a lone Thicket made for Love,
    Silent as yielding Maids Consent,
    She with a Charming Languishment,
    Permits his Force, yet gently strove;
