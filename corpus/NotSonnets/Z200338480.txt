There never was a name so bandied by fame,
    Thro' air, through' ocean, and through' land,
As one that is wrote upon every bank note,
    And you all must know Abraham Newland!
        Oh, Abraham Newland!
        Notified Abraham Newland!
I've herd people say, "sham Abraham" you may;
    But you mus'n't sham Abraham Newland.

For fashion or arts, should you seek foreign parts,
    It matters not where ever you land,
Jew, Christian, or Greek, the same language they speak,
    That's the language of Abraham Newland;
        Oh, Abraham Newland!
        Wonderful Abraham Newland!
