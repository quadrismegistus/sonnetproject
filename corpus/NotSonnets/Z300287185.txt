Judge me, O God, my pleading plead,
    against a perverse land:
Assert me from the wily head,
    and from the wrongers hand.

For of my strength the God thou art,
    why turnest thou me to go,
Opprest in habit as in heart,
    to mourn before the foe?

Send forth thy light and truth to fill
    my dark distrustful breast,
To guide me to thy holy Hill,
    thy Tabernacles rest.

Then to Gods Altar will I go,
    to God, my joys excess:
