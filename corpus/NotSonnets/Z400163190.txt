'TO was the good fast yacht, The Mermaid, that went sailing down the bay,
With a party predetermined to be jolly, one would say,
By the demijohns and boxes, by the lemons and the beer,
And the ice, that went aboard her just before she left the pier.

With the wind upon her quarter, how she courtesies and careens
To the nodding, laughing billows! how her tower of canvas leans!
Past the headland, by the islands, with the flying gulls she flew,
And her long wake lay behind her Like a stripe across the blue.

And I guess that all were happy on her deck, except, perhaps,
Mr. Brown -- one of your poetizing, sentimental chaps:
In the amid of joy and juleps he sits spiritless and pale,
With his chin upon his knuckles and his elbow on the rail -- 

Quite Byronic, I assure you -- and his mournful gaze intent
On the fascinating features of Miss Arabella Bent.
