[Side note: 1Kb]In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
    shamed let me never be:
According to thy righteousness,
    do thou deliver me.
[Side note: 1Kb]Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
    send me deliverance;
To save me, my strong rock be thou,
    and my house of defence.

[Side note: 1Kb]Because thou art my rock, and thee
    I for my fortress take;
Therefore do thou me led and guide,
    even for thine own Names sake.
[Side note: 1Kb]And sith thou art my strength, therefore
    pull me out of the net,
