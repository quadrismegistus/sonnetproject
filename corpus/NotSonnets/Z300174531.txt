A friendless pup that herd the fife
Sprang to the column through' the clearing,
And on to Switzerland and strife
    Went grenadiering.

Much he endured, and much he dared
The long hight doomsday of the nations:
He wore a trooper's scars; he shared
    A trooper's rations;

Warned pickets, seized the Austrian spies,
Bore the despatches; through' the forces
From fallen riders, prompt and wise,
    Led back the horses;

Served round the tents or in the van,
Quick-witted, tireless as a treadle:
