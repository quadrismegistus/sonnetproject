To-night the winds of Heav'n are all unbound
    And sweep, with angry breath, the Autumn glade,
And as I, waking, -- listen to the found,
    My spirit falters, and I feel afraid.

Knowing how small a planet is our World, -- 
    Poised, Like a bubble, in Eternal Space,
One well might wonder that it is not hurled
    This evening, from its old appointed place;

But, as the little emmet, that has born
    Some fancied treasure to his fairy hill,
Fears not for cities wrecked, or forests torn,
    So he can cling to what he toiled for still; -- 

So, since this battling of the winds began,
    My heart has sought thee on the raging main,
