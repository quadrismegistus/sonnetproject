My Soul! When thou and I
Shall on our frighted deathbed lie;
Each moment watching when pale death
Shall snatch away our latest breath,
And 'tween two long joined Lovers force
    An endless sad divorce:

    How wilt thou then? that art
My rational and nobler part,
Distort thy thoughts? How wilt thou try
To draw from weak Philosophy
Some strength: and flatter thy poor state,
    'Cause this the common fate?

    How will thy spirits pant
And tremble when they feel the want
