[Side note: 1Kb]I will of Judgement, and of mercy sing,
    The greatest Praises of the greatest King,
And since mine nothing worth, His own unto Him bring.

    'Twas He discovered to me first the Way,
    I'll follow where He showed the passage lay;
O, come, and led me, Lord, that I may never stray!

    With my integrity I'll never part,
    But be my Seed's as Thou my Pattern art,
And as Thy Way is perfect, so shall be my Heart.

    No wicked thing will I with pleasure see,
    My Innocent eyes no more shall guilty be,
Or look so low, since they have once been raised to Thee.

    I'll hate the work of him, who turns aside,
    His way from life, and happiness lies wide,
