Unto His servant on a day
The Lord revealed His hidden way.

He said: "Within this city great,
    Where sin still slays the Lamb of God,
What dost thou think I contemplate
    For comfort when I look abroad?"
His servant answered: "Yonder church
Crowded at Mass-time to the porch."

The Lord replied: "Not so"; and then,
    His servant guessed to make Him glad
The priest where he sat shriving men;
    The wounded healed; the orphan clad;
The widow's tears wiped off; the poor
Fed from another's little store.
