Weep not for him who hath laid his head,
On a pillow of earth, in the cypress shade -- 
For the sweetest dews that the night winds shed,
Descend on that couch for the sleeper made.

Weep not for him, though the wintery sleet
Throw its glittering folds over his manly breast -- 
That spotless robe is a covering meet,
For the shrouded soul in its home of rest.

Weep not for him, though his heart is still,
And the soul-lit eye Like a lamp grown dim -- 
Though the noble pulse, as and icy rill,
By the frost is chained -- O weep not for him!

The diamond gathers its purest ray,
In the hidden grot, where no sun is known --
