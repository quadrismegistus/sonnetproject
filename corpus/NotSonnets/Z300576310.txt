Travelling at night no man has any home
Beyond the station's melancholy dome.
The giant tired engine starts again
For homeless fields anonymous in rain,
Now it has gone. But that was not our train.
Even the kit-bag and the trundled can
Are cared-for and considered more than man
Who has been traveling since his life began.

His soul, uncomforted by cups of tea,
Envies the soul of the baby on his knee,
Escaped in peace from its small house of sense.
Even his grin for the barmaid was pretence;
And soon his cup will loose its tiny heat
Abandoned on the desert of a seat;
