Pine not too much, my Soul, nor mourn,
'Cause in this World you're left alone;
    Hereafter you will have,
A much more noble Prize than they,
Who only on their Pleasures prey,
    A Crown the other side the Grave.

The vain Desire to be great,
Is real hunger, but delusive Meat;
    They never stand to see
The Precipice that's coming on,
Till they are lost and quite undone,
        And buried in Eternity.

These common and vexatious Cares,
Which trouble and enlarge our Fears,
