Hast thou gone and left me
Void of faults but strictly true.
    Fly far away
    Without delay;
Adieu my love, adieu.

Hast thou gone and left me,
Hence to seek another bride;
    I must be still,
    Thou hast thy will;
The world is free and wide.

Only hadst thou told me,
Ere I drunk the bitter cup,
    I could with shame
    Now bear the blame,
