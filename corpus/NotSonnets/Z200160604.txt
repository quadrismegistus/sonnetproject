A little Dog-Woggy
    Once walked round the World:
So he shut up his house; and, forgetting
        His two puppy-children
    Locked in there, he curled
Up his tail in pink bombazine netting,
            And set out
            To walk round
                The World.

        He walked to Chicago,
    And herd of the Fair -- 
Walked on to New York, where he never, -- 
        In fact, he discovered
    That many folks there
