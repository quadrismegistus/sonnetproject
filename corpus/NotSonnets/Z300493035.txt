A good, a gracious act it is,
To praise the Lord, to celebrate his bliss:
    Thy name, o Highest, to renown,
With hymns, which earth with heav&eshort;ns high honour crown.
    Thy bount&eshort;ous grace, let springing day;
Let silent night, thy faithful truth display.
    Let ten-stringd lute, with violent sweet,
Melodious harp in sacred consort meet.
    Since joy to me thy work doth bring;
Thy works, great Lord, my thankful joy shall sing.
    O LORD, thy works how glorious great;
How deep thy thoughts, thoughts shalo to defeat?
    The floating brain of brutish man,
Not once observes, not once it fathom can;
