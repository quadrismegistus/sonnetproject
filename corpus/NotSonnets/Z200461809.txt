You wonder why within your arms
Laura, I seem to slight your charms;
And yet when seas our spirit part,
I waft you music of the heart.
    I am a poet, born to stray,
    And so my thoughts are far away.

When Byron on the Italian breast
His burning brow in passion pressed,
Dear Countess, while he gazed on you,
His soul to Mary Chaworth flew.
    He was a poet, born to stray,
    And so his thoughts were far away.

What woman will this satisfy
In England or in Italy?
