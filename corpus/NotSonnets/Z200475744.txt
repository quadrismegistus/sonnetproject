Hark! 'this the merry Bells' that ring
    On yonder upland sunny green;
Their sounds to mournful memory bring
    The blissful days and hours I've seen:
Their swelling changes die away,
So did my heart's best love decay!

Hark! 'this the Beetle flitting round,
    O'er yonder hawthorn fresh and sweet;
Once could I mock the drowsy found,
    With Henry on the greensward seat:
But now I weep to hear its tone,
For, O! my heart's true love is flown!

Hark! 'this the Raven's dismal croak,
    My boding breast is chilled with fear!
