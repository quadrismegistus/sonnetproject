From the crystalline courts of the temple of light,
    The dove-eye of Mercy to earth was directed,
Where mortals were groveling, deep shrouded in night;
    For passion was worshipped and wisdom rejected:
        Immersed in each ill
        Of corrupted freewill,
Yet Mercy was patient, and Patience slept still:
    For infinite Love had his banner unfurled,
    And the precepts of wisdom were preached to the world.

But haughty Ambition extended his reign,
    And wielded the sceptre of magic delusion,
Held Reason enshackled in Tyranny's chain,
    And governed by knowledge and learning's exclusion.
        With mitre and hood,
