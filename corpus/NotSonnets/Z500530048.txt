How pure the blessed spirits there,
Who bright celestial bodies wear,
    No more to earth allied.
Consummated in joy unknown,
For ever blessed, for ever one,
    With Jesus glorified.

O that we might begin below
The life angelical to know,
    Our faithfulness approve,
Present with God in every place,
Perform His will, and see His face
    In purity of love!

Jesus, the holiness impart,
Earnest of glory in my heart,
