I am waiting for you.
I have been traveling all morning through the bush
and not eaten.
I am lying at the edge of the bush
on a dusty path that leads from the burnt-out kraal.
I am panting, it is midday, I found no water-hole.
I am very fierce without food and although my eyes
are screwed to slits against the sun
you must believe I am prepared to spring.

What do you think of me?
I have a rough coat Like Africa.
I am crafty with dark spots
Like the bush-tufted plains of Africa.

I sprawl as a shaggy bundle of gathered energy
