When he began to witness, it was not to a journey,
Nor the questions, nor the answers, nor fiery London.   Whole
For the first time in imagination, man in conflict
May tell, as he enters, that there is and entrance.
Fire never yet felled this man's pillar;
His bed is at home, where he knows it is.
Love weaves him in, love guards the locks, and love
Sends his eyes a bravery of language.
But the eyes of the man are the eyes of witness
He will never acknowledge the old polarities.
Question and answer carry the oppositions,
And success.   And defeat.
Now no one can declare
With any finality, The Day After The War.
