O hadst thou seen Carl Ritter, won and pale,
    Walking at eve with melancholy mien,
Drinking the music of the nightingale
    With fierce delight, where on the current green
Of Leipsic's moat the water-lilies sail
    In snowy fleets, thou wouldst have burned, I ween,
To know somewhat of the sad history
Of that wild footstep and dejected eye.

Love -- who could doubt it? -- in his being wrought
    Hotly and hopelessly; and he had rued,
But all too late, the passion's sultry drought,
    Which dried youth's wells that cannot be renewed.
And there he walks, or rather runs, by thought,
    Like old Act√¶on by his dogs, pursued;
