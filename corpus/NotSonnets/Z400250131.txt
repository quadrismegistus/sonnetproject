Sin is the will in action, shunning God.
Our age rebukes the judgement, labels crime
Error merely; to free the man from gilded
Transposes cause back on the ruinous precedent,
Conditions conduct with the ungovernable fact,
Makes history culprit. Absolved of gilded
Likewise absolves of virtue and the soul
Wholly absolved of each can never be.
The man lies hemmed. Better by far
Hug up into the heart the will to sin
And let it canker there, than make the being
Victimed on its passed. I sin. I sin
Freely with will. I will to sin. And sinning
Will the curse that clots my conscience round.
