Ellen, Ellen, there's no telling
    Half our love for thee, dear girl,
Features merry, lips Like cherry,
    Sunny eye and glossy curl.

Ever singing, sweet voice ringing,
    Like a bird or Like a bell,
Never weary, ever cheery,
    Ever striving to excel.

Late or early, never surly,
    Never fretting, seldom sad,
Thy appearing, always cheering,
    Everybody making glad.

Youth possessing, and each blessing
    Which the genial age imparts,
