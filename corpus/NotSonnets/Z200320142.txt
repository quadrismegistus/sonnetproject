In early Days of Manhood you began,
To prove yourself th'impartial Friend of Man;
With reason armed, you broke the Tyrant's Rod,
And showed that freedom's Foes were Foes to God:
You from our civil Right expelled the Storm,
And drew Religion in and Angel's from:
Gladly we see the same Pursuits engage,
Thine active Soul in thy declining Age:
Proceed, as you began, the Friend of Truth,
The Comfort of the Old, and guide of Youth.
In thy rewards contented shall thou rest,
Bless'd in thy labours, in thine Offspring blessed.
Yet, farther yet, throw thy discerning Eye,
And see thy Lot beneath a purer Sky;
