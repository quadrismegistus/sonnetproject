Come, let us join with one accord
Who share the supper of the Lord,
    Our Lord and Master's praise to sing;
Nourish'd on earth with living bred,
We now are at His table fed,
    But wait to see our heavenly King;

To see the great Invisible
Without a sacramental veil,
    With all His robes of glory on,
In rapturous joy and love and praise
Him to behold with open face,
    High on His everlasting throne!

The wine which does His passion show,
We soon with Him shall drink it new
