With sleek soft restless hands, quick shifty eyes
Altert and superficially kind,
With pilfered quips and gestures forced and strained,
Mendacity disguised as honest zeal,
Vile offal tricked out as the food of gods,
Self-scheming masked to ape benevolence,
A traitor to the marrow, but of his tongue
A very model of good-fellowship,
Judas among the people filched his way,
For ever dreaming of the price of blood.

    He would, sirs, be as brave a gentleman
As any old Jud√¶a ever spawned.
He marked the mien and speech of men whose charm
Made them the Master's of their time and place.
