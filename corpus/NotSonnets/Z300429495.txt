"The best of parents blessed my younger days;
"What others teach with frowns, they taught with praise.
"They held, to praise one virtue would inspire
"A generous manly soul to aim at higher.
"While he, whose rising talents were repressed,
"With a great genius never will be blessed.
"Thus plant a vine on Nor'way's rocky coast,
"Soon will it die, nipped by the chilling frost:
"But in a warmer sun, and kindlier soil
"Will spread amain, and big with clusters smile.
"Yet some are Like the fir, by kindness lost,
"Which thrives but on a rough and barren coast.

"My father joyed to show the pleasant road,
"That leads through' nature, up to nature's God.
