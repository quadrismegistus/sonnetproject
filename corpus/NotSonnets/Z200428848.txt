How blessed the Souls, their God who fear,
His Pow'r confess, his Law revere!
O happy Thou! ordained to share
Thy Maker's ever constant care.
Thou privileged from want shalt stand,
And eat the labour of thy hand.
The Object of thy wedded Love
Prolific as the Vine shall prove,
Whose foliage over thy walls displayed
Spreads wide its amicable shade:
While, as the Olive-branches fair,
Around thy board thy infant Care
Shall crowd, and bid thy heart overflow
With joys that only Parents know.
