Her lips are full, magenta-red
in colour -- 

Bare-chested, she wears a yellow silk
loincloth.
I cup my right hand
under her blue chin
and bend to kiss her,
encircling her waist with my left arm.

Her back to me, she turns

Strings of pearls,
lion-claw necklaces and
rubies and gold round her neck.

Her skin is dark,
dark as the skin of the blue God.
