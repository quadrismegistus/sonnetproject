Me thinks 'this time to know the joys of love,
'Toward great Hymen's altar time to move;
And now no longer ward, 'this fit you be
Guardian to some transcendent Deitie,
And make some wealthy beauty fortunate,
Not only in the share of your estate
And honours, but i'th' richer treasury
Of your fair person, and your sparkling eye,
Where a bright, radiant soul displays
Its chaster twinkling flames, Like the Suns rays
In a clear Crystal font, when Zephyrus
That modest, lukewarm, Virgin-incubus
Makes the sweet Nymph hold out (the lovers bliss)
Cool trembling lips to take a passant kiss:
