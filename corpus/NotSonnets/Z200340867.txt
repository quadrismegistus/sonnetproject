Unseasonable man, statue of ice,
    What could to countries solitude entice
Thee, in this years cold and decrepit time?
    Natures instinct draws to the warmer climb
Even small birds, who by that courage dare,
    In numerous fleets, sail through their Sea, the air.
What delicacy can in fields appear,
    Whil'st Flora'herselfe does a freeze jerkin wear?
Whil'st winds do all the trees and hedges strip
    Of leaves, to furnish rods enough to whip
Thy madness from thee; and all springs by frost
    Have taken cold, and their sweet murmurs lost;
If thou thy faults or Fortune's wouldst lament
    With just solemnity, do it in Lent;
