It came upon the noontide air,
    Like thunderbolt from clearest skies;
Stout hearts were clad in soar despair,
    And floods of tears flowed from all eyes.
Across the States and over the plain,
    And to the distant Isles it sped;
From mountain height to sea's domain,
    Flashed the sad message, "Shorter's dead!"

From lip to lip the sad news ran,
    From every breast arose a sighs;
Awestricken stood the stoutest man,
    Till hope bade all look up on high.
God still is just, alwise is He -- 
    What He hath taken He can send;
