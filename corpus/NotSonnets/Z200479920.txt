Sirra, what are you? where's your dwelling place?
Sirs bring the Lanthorne, let me see his face.
Dost know him Beadle? Surely sir not I.
Ant please your worship I do lodge hereby,
I have been forth at supper with a friend.
Tell me of supper, tut a puddings end
You kiss the Counter sirrah that is flat,
Isle teach you know my place deserves a hat.
Ant please your worship, I confess it does
But pardon me, my head's not well in sooth.
You think all hours of the night to march
Because you're in your yellow closestool starch.
Hast not Tabacco, and a tynder box?
The knave may fire the town, have him to stocks.
