A Clergyman in Berkshire dwelled,
    The Reverend Bernard Powles,
And in his church there weekly knelt
    At least a hundred souls.

There little Ellen you might see,
    The modest rustic belle;
In maidenly simplicity,
    She loved her Bernard well.

Though Ellen wore a plain silk gown
    Untrimmed with lace or fur,
Yet not a husband in the town
    But wished his wife Like her.

Though sterner memories might fade,
    You never could forget
