Come now unto the Forest, and enjoy
The loveliness of nature. Look abroad
And note the tender beauty, and repose
Of the magnificent, in earth and sky.
See what a radiant smile of golden light
O'erspreads the face of heaven; while the west
Burns Like a living ruby, in the ring
Of the deep green horizon. Now the shades
Are deepening round the feet of the tall trees,
Bending the head of the pale blossoms down
Upon their mother's bosom, where the breeze
Comes with a low sweet hymn and balmy kiss,
To lull them to repose. Look now, and see
How every mountain, with its leafy plume,
