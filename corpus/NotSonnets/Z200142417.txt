Survey the State, behold the flame that draws
Chiefs, mobs, conventions, to support thy cause.
See where the frogs' loquacious realms extend,
Instructions on their deputies attend,
O'er all the east new fangled magi rise,
Join croaking choirs and boast the name of wise.

The north by myriads pours her mighty sons,
Great nurse of mobs, of bankrupts, and of duns:
There Froth, the separate, glows with popular rage,
And G&wblank;n, type of dotards in old age.

Where lard and brimstone gild the itch-vat shore,
The soil that trays and wooden dishes boar,
His full-globed paunch the brainless Bubo draws,
And solid ignorance threats the feeble laws.
