Jesus, Thy sovereign will
    Doth nature's course control;
O bid my sun of life stand still,
    And stop my parting soul:
    My soul in life detain,
    Till Thou hast all subdued,
Avenged me of my foes, and slave
    The whole accursed brood.

    O that the work were done,
    That sin were all destroyed!
How swiftly should I then go down,
    How gladly set in God:
    Sure with the morning rays
    Of that great day to rise,
