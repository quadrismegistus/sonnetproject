Yes, 'this a glorious sighed,
This valley, that mountain hight.

The river plunges and roars
Like the loud sea on its shores

What time in waves enorm
Breaks the gigantic storm.

The wooded mount does climb
To a thought intense, sublime.

The glory of all I feel;
But my heart, my heart, will steal

Down the journey of years,
Through the lands of laughter and tears,

Far back to the least of valleys
Where a slow brook curves and dallies,
