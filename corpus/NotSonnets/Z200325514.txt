I grant that ever since the World began
The Gods claimed Worship from their Creature Man.
But then, in Offerings frugal as in Food,
Their Altars stood unstained with Victim Blood;
They offered best who practised to be Good.
As yet no foreign Ship with Spices fraught
Had Myrrh and Frankincense from India brought.
Far off concealed along Euphrates Shore
Those balmy Shrubs their fragrant Blossoms boar.
Unvalu'd the rich Cordial Crocus grew,
Or only valued for it's purple Hue.
The Priest their Virtues first perceived, and then
The Gods required 'em at the Hands of Men.
Before, green Potherbs of good savoury Smell,
