The other night as in my bed
    I lay profoundly sleeping,
An angel babe with hairless head
    Came through the darkness creeping;
And, waking at the dawn of day,
    Bliss percolated through me
When, smiling in her artless way,
    She murmured "papam" to me.

Strange, was it not? But stranger still
    What next claimed my attention -- 
The robes of wealth with tuck and frill
    Too numerous to mention.
Whence came these bibs with lace bedecked -- 
    These flannels all so handy?
