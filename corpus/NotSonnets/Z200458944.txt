THE minds of those who dwell in this our day
With the heaped heritage of many and age
Are, with the fear, the grief, the impotent rage,
Poisoned of pain bygone and passed affray;
And in their hearts the horror and dismay
Of many a bloodstained grim historic page.
When false Gods reveled on the worldly stage,
Too deep are graved for Time to wash away.
So intimate the impress, so soar the strain
Of the rememorance of ancestral woe
Is on each fibre of the heart and brain,
That the whole force and fabric of their will
Is weakened grown and they no longer know
Wholly to love the Good or hate the Ill.
