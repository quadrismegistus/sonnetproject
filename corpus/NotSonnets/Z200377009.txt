If fame may be believed, I am he
To whom and Infant can no relate be,
Yet blessed with issue by a higher fate
And that both many and legitimate:
Not only people, with their priests together,
But also Kings vouchsafe to call me father.
Thousands of souls O Christ have been by me
Begotten through thy holy Word to thee.

Who knows not learned Beza, what dull ear
Hath not large volumes of his history there?
Or what ill furnished Gallery cannot show
His reverend Picture, marshaled in the row
Of rare and modern Worthies, to advance
The glory of his pen renowned France?
