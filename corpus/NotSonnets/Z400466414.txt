Judge of words without a meaning;
Arbiter 'tween black and white;
Fusing all the shades of difference
Into day or into night.

Cunning, cheating, grim magician;
Plunderer both of age and youth;
Slave of forms and senseless customs;
Laugher at the light of truth.

Has my life, then, all been wasted,
Threading thy bewildering ways?
Have I lost the hopeful morning?
Spoiled the evening of my days?

Down, thou Shape of hair and ermine!
Quit thy high disgrac√®d place.
