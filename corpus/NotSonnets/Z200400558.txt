Sing for the Oak-Tree,
    The monarch of the wood;
Sing for the Oak-Tree,
    That grows green and good:
That grows broad and branching
    Within the forest shade;
That grows now, and yet shall grow
    When we are lowly laid!

The Oak-Tree was and acorn once,
    And fell upon the earth;
And sun and showers nourished it,
    And gave the Oak-Tree birth.
The little sprouting Oak-Tree!
    Two leaves it had at first,
