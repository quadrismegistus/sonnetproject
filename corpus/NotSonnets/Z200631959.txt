IN Parliament, whenever a question comes,
Which makes the Chief look grave and bite his thumbs,
A knowing one is sent -- shy as a mouse,
To peep into the humour of the House;
I am that mouse, peeping at friends and foes,
To find which carry it, the Ayes or Noah's.
With more than power of Parliament you sit,
Despotic representatives of wit!
For in a moment, and without much pother,
You can dissolve this piece and call another.
 -- As 'this no treason, let us frankly see
In what they differ, and in what agree.
The said supreme assembly of the nation,
With this our great dramatic Convocation!
