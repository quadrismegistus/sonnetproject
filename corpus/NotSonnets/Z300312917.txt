This scene how beauteous to the musing mind
That now swift slides from my enchanted view
The sun sweet setting yond far hills behind
In other world's his visits to renew
What spangling glories all around him shine
What nameless colours cloudless & serene
Rich heavenly colours brightest in decline
Atend his exit from this lovley scene
So sets the Christians sun in glories clear
So shines his soul at his departure here
No clouding doubts nor misty fears arise
To dim Hope's golden rays of being forgiven
His sun sweet setting in the clearest skies
In safe assurance wings the soul to heaven
