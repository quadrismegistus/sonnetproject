Like as the silly soul,
    That feels himself distressed,
With heavy burden on his back,
    does seek to be at rest.
So I whom love long time,
    hath led in Captive bands,
Enforced am at last to sue
    for favour at thy hands,
That hast my heart in hold,
    who only mayest apply,
Some pleasant potion to assuage
    the grievous malady,
Which long with little ease,
    and most incessant grief.
