Tremendous oracle Divine!
    Who can the harsh command obey!
"That son, that only son of thine,
    That son beloved, that Isaac slay!"
Whoe'er the God of Abraham know,
    Their faith by Like obedience prove,
And offering up their Isaacs show
    The power supreme of Jesu's love.

Father, Thou callest me by my name,
    Thy sovereign pleasure to fulfil,
And lo, through grace I ready am
    To answer all Thy awful will,
By faith I climb the mountain-top,
    Thy blessings cheerfully resign,
