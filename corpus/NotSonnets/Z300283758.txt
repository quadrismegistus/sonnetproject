Now the State's brains, are addle,
With a new fiddle faddle,
    And Politick Body Disorder'd,
        And reels too and from,
        (As Good fellows do)
    In reason, that cannot be bordered:
VVhile, Drunk with their Wealth,
(Made Sweeter by Stealth)
        They, Coop't in their Own,
        Seek Kingdoms to come,
                And fancy, beyond-sea-Vagaries;
VVe, sit Close at Home,
Content, with Lipp Room;
        In the Infinite Space,
