It is not yet a fortnight, since
Lutetia entertained our Prince,
And vented hath a studied Toy,
As long as was the siege of Troy:
    And spent her self for full five days
    In Speeches, Exercise, and Playes.

To trim the town great care before
Was taken by that' Lord Vicechancellour,
Both morn and Even he cleansed the way,
The streets he graveled thrice a day:
    One strike of march-dust for to see,
    No Proverbe would give more then he.

Their Colledges were new bepainted,
Their Founders eke, were new besainted,
