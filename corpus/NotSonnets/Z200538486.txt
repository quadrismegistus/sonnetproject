When cursed Oppression rears his brazen crest,
Withholds one half, and strains to seize the rest;
When those in power disdaining shame or dread,
Half starve those wretches they pretend to feed;
Then should the Muse, with honest zeal inspired,
With hate of gilded and vile injustice fired;
Disclose their crimes, and to the world display
The gloomy catalogue in deep array;
Till Vice confounded, hides her haggard head,
And lovely Virtue rises in her stead.

Receive th'enclosed, nor blame the daring strains,
Since truth confirms each perjod it contains;
And poor Experience, from the listening throng,
Sad shakes her head, and owns the honest sung.
