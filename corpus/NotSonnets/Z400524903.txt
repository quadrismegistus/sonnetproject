My Father, O my Father, hear
    Thy weakest child's imperfect call!
Now as a servant I appear,
    And yet Thou knowest me heir of all:
O make me know as I am known;
Speak, Father; am I not Thy son?

Allured by unresisted grace,
    Thy footsteps why did I pursue?
Why did I ever seek Thy face?
    What secret power my spirit drew
After I knew not whom to run?
Speak, Father; am I not Thy son?

From whom have all my blessings flowed?
    Who gave me these enlarged desires?
