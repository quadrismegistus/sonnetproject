Rougher than Death the road I choose
Yet shall my feet not walk astray,
Though dark, my way I shall not loose
For this way is the darkest way.

Set but a limit to the loss
And something shall at last abide
The bloodstained beams that from the cross
The thorns that crown the crucified;

But who shall loose all things in One,
Shut out from heaven and the pit
Shall loose the darkness and the sun
The finite and the infinite;

And who shall see in one small flower
The chariots and the thrones of might
