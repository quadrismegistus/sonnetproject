Let not the wise his wisdom boast,
    The mighty glory in his might,
The rich in flattering riches trust
    Which take their everlasting flight;
The rush of numerous years bears down
    The most gigantic strength of man,
And where is all his wisdom gone,
    When dust, he turns to dust again!

One only gift can justify
    The boasting soul that knows his God;
When Jesus does His blood apply,
    I glory in His sprinkled blood.
The Lord my righteousness I praise,
    I triumph in the love Divine,
