O deeply learned, wisely modest, tell -- 
Is it a fault to Like thy praise so well?
Pleased to be praised by thee, my spirits glow,
And could I ever, I could paint her now.
I meet her beauty's in a brighter ray,
And in my eyebeams all her graces play.

Painting, great goddess, mocks my vain desires,
Her lofty art a lofty soul requires;
Long studies too, and fortune at command,
An eye unwearied, and a patient hand;
And, if I cannot brook to be confined,
What scenes of nature should instruct my mind;
At home, abroad, in sunshine, and in storms,
I should observe her in a thousand forms;
