VVhen as I mark the joy of every wight,
Howe in their minds deep throbbing sorrow ceases
And by what means they nourish their delight,
Their sweet delight my pain the more increases.
For as the Dear that sees his fellow feed,
Amid the lusty herd, himself soar bruised:
Or as the bird that feels herself to bleed,
And lies aloof of all her pheeres refused.
So have I found and now too dearly try,
That pleasure doubles pain and bliss annoy:
Yet still I twit my self of Surcuidrie,
As one that am unworthy to enjoy.
The lasting fruit of such a heavenly love,
For whom these endless sorrows I approve.
