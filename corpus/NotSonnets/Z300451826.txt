Nature gives all creatures arms,
Faithful guards from hostile harms!
Jaws, the lion to defend;
Horrid jaws, that wide distend!
Horns, the bull; resistless force!
Solid hoofs, the generous horse;
Nimble feet, the fearful hare;
Wings, the bird, to sail in air;
Fins, the fish, through' sea to roll;
Man, the virtues of the soul.

Thus she lavished all her store -- 
What for woman had she more?
Beauty to her share did fall;
Beauty! the best guard of all!
