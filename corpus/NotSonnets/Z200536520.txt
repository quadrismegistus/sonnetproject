A youth, a pupil of the town,
Philosopher and atheist grown,
Benighted once upon the road,
Found out a Hermit's lone abided,
Whose hospitality in needs
Reliev'd the traveler and his steed,
For both sufficiently were tired,
Well drenched in ditches and bemired.
Hunger the first attention claims;
Upon the coals a rasher flames,
Dry crusts, and liquour something stale,
Were added to make up a meal;
At which our traveler as he sat
By intervals began to chat. --
