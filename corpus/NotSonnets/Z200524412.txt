In memorable brass let there be writ
An everlasting story of a King:
Marvel of men! wonder of chiefest wit!
Eternal glory does to England bring.
So let his style be framed, and he be said,
England's true King, successor of a Maid.

Know foreign powers: England's true loyalty,
Is bent in service to her Sovereign King:
Nor shall the fierce allar'ms, nor frown of enemy
Give alteration, or daunted courage bring.
O no, she shall, first in a scarlet flood,
Fight to the lips, with lose of dearest blood.

Even as the day which first proclaimed his name,
Never as yet did seem to make and end:
