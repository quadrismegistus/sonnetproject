Oh! the camp's delightful rigs,
    At which such crowds are peeping,
Where chaises, dillies, carts, and gigs,
    Serve both to ride and sleep in.

Oh! the joys that there abound,
    Where, lured by the fine weather,
Warriors of every rank are found,
Who, higgledy piggledy, on the ground,
    Like gipsies big together.

    The morning-gun
    Begins the fun,
Reveilles next the drum beats;
    The sprightly fife,
    So full of life,
