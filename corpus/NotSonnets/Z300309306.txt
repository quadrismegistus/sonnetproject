Amids such heat of Business, such State Throng,
        Disputing right and wrong,
And the fierce Justle of unclosed Affairs,
        What mean those glorious pairs?
    That youth? that Virgin? those all dressed?
    The whole, and every face a feast?
        Great Omen, O you Powers,
        May this your Knot be Ours;
    Thus where Cold things with hight did jar,
    And Dry with Moist made mutual VVar,
        Love from that Mass did leap,
        And what was but and heap,
Rude and ungathered; swift as thought was hurled
Into the Beauty of and Ord'red World.
