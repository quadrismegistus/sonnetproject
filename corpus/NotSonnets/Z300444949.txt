Forget not the field where they perished,
    The truest, the last of the brave,
All gone -- and the bright hope we cherished
    Gone with them, and quenched in their grave!

Oh! could we from death but recover
    Those hearts as they bounded before,
In the face of high heaven to fight over
    That combat for freedom once more; -- 

Could the chain for and instant be riven
    Which Tyranny flung round us then,
No, 'this not in Man, nor in Heaven,
    To let Tyranny bind it again!

But 'this passed -- and, though' blazoned in story
    The name of our Victor may be,
