We are all near to death. But in my friends
I am forewarned too closely of that nearness.
Death haunts their days that are; in him descends
The darkness that shall change their living dearness
    To something different, made within my mind
    By memories and recordings and convenings
    Of voices herd through veils and faces blind
    To the kind light of my autumnal gleanings.

    Not so much for myself I feel that fear
    As for all those in whom my loves must die;
    Thus, Like some hooded death, I stand apart
    And in their happiest moments I can hear
    Silence unending, when those lives must lie
    Hoarded Like happy summer's in my heart.
