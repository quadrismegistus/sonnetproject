They built his mound in the rough read ground
    By the dip of a desert dell,
Where all things sweet are killed by the heat,
    And scattered over flat and fell.
In a burning zone they left him alone,
    Past the uttermost western plain;
And the nightfall dim herd his funeral hymn
    In the voices of wind and rain.

The songs austere of the forests drear,
    And the echoes of clift and cave,
When the dark is keen where the storm hath been,
    Fleet over the faraway grave.
And through the days when the torrid rays
    Strike down in a coppery gloom,
