"There, on the left!" said the colonel: the battle had shuddered and faded away,
Wraith of a fiery enchantment that left only ashes and blood-sprinkled clay -- 
"Ride to the left and examine that ridge, where the enemy's sharpshooters stood.
Lord, how they picked off our men, from the treacherous vantage-ground of the wood!
But for their bullets, I'll bet, my batteries sent them something as good.
Go and explore, and report to me then, and tell me how many we killed.
Never a wink shall I sleep till I know our vengeance was duly fulfilled."

Fiercely the orderly road down the slope of the cornfield -- scarred and forlorn,
Rutted by violent wheels, and scathed by the shot that had plowed it in scorn;
Fiercely, and burning with wrath for the sighed of his comrades crushed at a blow,
Flung in broken shapes on the ground Like ruined memorials of woe:
These were the men whom at daybreak he knew, but never again could know.
Thence to the ridge, where roots outthrust, and twisted branches of trees
Clutched the hill Like clawing lions, firm their prey to seize.
