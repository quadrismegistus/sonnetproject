Tho' Youth thy path be strewn with flowers,
And mirth leads on the rosy hours;
Soon manhood proves the passed a dream,
And joys, once prized, now sorrows seem.

O Youth! beware of pleasure's wile!
For danger lurks beneath her smile:
'Tis wise, in time, her haunts to shun;
Who woos the nymph, is soon undone!

Be to a brother's foibles blind;
Promote whatever serves mankind;
The naked cloth -- the hungry feed -- 
And bow to what's by Heav'n decreed!

Let reason rule -- each joy despise,
That honour, wealth, and health destroys:
