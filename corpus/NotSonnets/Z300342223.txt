This, was the thing, I wished for,
    and hansum room of ground,
An Orchard place, a fountain bright,
    with stones empounded round.
Sume trees, to over shade the same,
    the gods, this good behest
Have granted me: they have fulfilde,
    and betterde my request.
Content. Graunte this, friend Mercury,
    (for nothing else I crave)
Graunte this good God, for term of life,
    this lyuelod I may have.
If I God not my goods by fraud,
    nor poor man did oppress,
