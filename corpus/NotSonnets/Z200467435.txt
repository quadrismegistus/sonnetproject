O liberty! celestial maid!
Where has thy vagrant fancy strayed?
Dost thou from Andes' rifted brow
See boundless empires spread below,
See Orellana pour his stream
Through forests vast, where yet the beam
Of garish day could never come
To penetrate the twilight gloom?
Dost thou thy glowing bosom lave
In shining Plata's sea-broad wave?
Or dost thou listen to the roar,
Where the collected waters pour
Their dreadful course, and foaming sweep
Down Niagara's horrid steep?
