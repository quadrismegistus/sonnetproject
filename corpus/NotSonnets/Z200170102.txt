Hail to the holy rite divine,
That binds the heart to Love's decree,
Where hands with thrilling transport join,
And souls are locked in unity!

Sweet is the poet's flower the rose,
Unfenc'd with its protecting thorn;
But ah! more sweet its beauty shows,
And richer tints its robes adorn,

When so exposed that toil and care
Are both required to reach its charms -- 
It bids that' approaching swain beware,
For its obtrusive thorn alarms.

This truth, you happy couple, blessed,
Do you not feel in every vein --
