Apollo's fabled Aid I scorn,
    Nor court the vocal Throng:
For, Carlow's Nymphs shall now adorn,
    And animate my Song;
The Nymphs, who haunt the Barrow's Side,
    Where Pleasure smiling reigns;
The Grace, the Dignity, the Pride,
    Of Carlow's happy Swains.

Oh! had you seen them, in the Dance,
    With sprightly Gesture move,
And now retreat -- and now advance,
    In all the Pomp of Love,
Your Heart would at one View have felt
    That tender, generous Fire,
