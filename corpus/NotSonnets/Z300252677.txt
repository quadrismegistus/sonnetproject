Under dazzling wonder bowed,
The city, anchored in a cloud,
Is heaped with white and glittering glory
As from some immemorial story.
The city under all the snow
Is thumbed by a white Prospero,
Who rubs all fines and angles out,
Erasing landmarks all about.
Walls of the houses in the glow
Pour Niagaras of snow,
Whose flakes, unhurried, sift or cling, -- 
Velvet sleep unpetalling....
Till the snow-piled city seems
Coral isles upheave in dreams,
