I Sighs, and lament me in vain,
    These walls can but echo my moan;
Alas! it increases my pain,
    To think of the days that are gone.

Through the grates of my prison I see
    The birds as the wanton in air;
My heart, how it pants to be free,
    My looks they are wild with despair.

Ye roofs, where cold damps and dismay
    With silence and solitude dwell;
How comfortless passes the day,
    How sad tolls the evening bell!

The owls from the battlements cry,
    Hollow winds seem to murmur around,
