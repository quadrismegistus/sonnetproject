No Walls with Ivory inlaid
Adorn my House, no Colonade
Proudly supports a Citron Beam,
Nor rich with Gold my Cielings flame;
Nor have I, Like and Heir unknown,
Seiz'd upon Attalus his Throne;
Nor Dames, to happier Fortune's bred,
Draw down for Me the purple Thread;
Yet with a firm and honest Heart,
Unknowing or of Fraud or Art,
A liberal Vein of Genius blessed,
I'm by the Rich and Great carest.
My Patron's Gift, my Sabine Field
Shall all its rural Plenty yield,
