Green slope of autumn fields,
    And soft November sun,
And golden leaves -- they linger yet,
While tasseled pines new fragrance get,
    Though summertime is done.

The hedgerows wear a veil
    Of glistening spider threads,
And in the trees along the brook
The clematis, Like whiffs of smoke,
    Its faded garland spreads.

See, here upon my hand,
    This gauzy-winged wild be!
Now that the winds are laid,
He suns him unafraid
