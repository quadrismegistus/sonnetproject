Yes! thou art doomed to meet full many a frown,
    Perhaps, from pride's rude offspring, who despise
The worth of tremulous diffidence, and crown
    Each dazzling attribute with virtue's prize.
Yet, if amid the stormy wilderness
    Of life, some friend thy gentle spirit find;
Spite of the unfeeling million, he shall bless,
    With warm sincerity, thy kindred mind.
But trust not the found look, the specious smile:
    Nor deem that over thy path the unsetting light
Of friendship beams. -- Alas! if free from guile,
    Thou wilt the poor, the timid caution slight!
How hard their lot, who feel its valve most,
To shed the bitter tear for friendship lost!
