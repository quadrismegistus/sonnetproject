The cold light die, the candles glow,
The wind whirls down the bore allee
Outside my gleaming window-panes
The phantom populations go,
Blown, amid leaves, above, below.

Yet these are solid Germane folk
Outside, beneath the thinning planes
And the reflections that awoke
At candle time upon my panes
Are misty, unsubstantial gleams.

Only outside, obscurity,
The waning light, the cold blue beams
And rafts of shadow trick the eye;
So that the frozen passers-by
