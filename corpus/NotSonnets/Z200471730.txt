With rifle, bible, luncheon-bag, and pipe,
We saw him going forth each day to snipe;
We watched him on the foemen get his bead
Then fire, then turn his Holy Book to read,
Some chapter from the Kings would suit his case,
That told how Israel smote a godless raze,
How hip and thigh, at Heaven's august command
The Hebrew drove the Hivite from the land;
He could not wish the modern Hivites well
Seeing we hid in holes from shot and shell;
Or else from Kings he turned for hope and calm
To Kruger's late commended battle-psalm. [Footnote: 1Kb]
Then could we note how he would luncheon take
 -- His bit of biltong and his barley-cake,
