I was foretold your Rebel Sex nor love nor pity knew,
And with what scorn you use to vex poor Hearts that humbly sue:
But I believe, to crown our pain, could we the fortress win,
A happy Lover sure should gain a Paradise within.
I thought Loves plagues Like Dragons sat,
Only to fright us at the Gate.

If I did enter and enjoy what happy Lovers prove,
I would Kiss, and Sport, and Toy, and taste those Sweets of Love:
Or had they but a lasting fate, or if in CÃ¦lia's breast,
Or of Love might not abate, Jove was too mean a Guest:
    But now her breach of faith far more
    Afflicts than did her Scorn before.

Hard Fate! to have been once possessed as Victor of a Heart,
Atchiev'd with labour and unrest, and then forced to Depart.
