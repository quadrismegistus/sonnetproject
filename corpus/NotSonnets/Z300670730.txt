All the virtues, all the graces, all the folk of fame and rank,
All with husbands in high places and with money in the bank;
They were there to talk serenely over things too deep for man,
But in that assemblage queenly not a sign of Mary Ann.

Yet the reason in that weather -- which was not Elysian -- 
That had brought them all together -- it was simply Mary Ann.
They themselves were high and gifted, and addressed themselves as such;
But M.A. must be uplifted -- just a little, not too much.

They would not, perhaps, have kissed her had she lumbered in uncouth,
But they said she was their sister, and, maybe, they spoke the truth.
She must get and understanding how to use her leisure hours -- 
And the A.D.C.'s were handing cups of tea among the flowers.

Mary Ann was at the washtub washing for these ladies fine;
Mary Ann was at the mash-tub mixing food for hogs or kine;
