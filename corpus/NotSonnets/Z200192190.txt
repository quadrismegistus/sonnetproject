I see the green Fiesole arise,
A pyramid whose flowers and vine-clad steeps,
Are proudly crowned by ancient walls, where lies
The latest loveliest sunbeam when it sleeps
To shade and Arno winding through the vale,
Grows brighter as the shades of earth prevail -- 
Fiesole and Arno both are famed in sung
I view your beauty; but I cannot feel;
And grieve to find my heart can do me wrong.
There is a blight on me, a stoney chill -- 
Upon the glow of heaven and earth I gaze,
But do not burn as in my earlier days -- 

O let me leave the world if it can steal
Nature's best dower from me -- the gift to feel.
