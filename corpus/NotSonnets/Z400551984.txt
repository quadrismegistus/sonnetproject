There were two Scottish boys, one roamed seashore and hill
Drunk with the beauty of many a lovely scene,
And finally lost in nature's glory as in a fog,
Tossing him into chaos, Like Bunyan's quag in the Valley of the Shadow.
The other having shot a lean and ferocious cat
On his father's farm, was profoundly interested
In a tapeworm he found when he investigated
Its internal machinery in the seclusion of his attic room,
 -- A 'prologue to the omen coming on'!

For while the first yielded nothing but high-falutin nonsense,
Spiritual masturbation of the worst description,
From the second down the crowded years I saw
Heroism, power for and practice of illimitable good emerge,
Great practical imagination and God-like thoroughness,
