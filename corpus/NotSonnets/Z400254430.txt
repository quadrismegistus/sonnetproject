Foster excellence. If I do not
who will do it? The vulgarity
of my country makes the spirit faint, what we
have misdone to our history and what
to our landscape. The tasteless food we eat,
our music, how we waste day after day
child, woman, and man, have stunned me to dismay
Like and ox bludgeoned, swaying on his feet

 -- John, rescue me by becoming! I have well
deserved of this republic, though it has
rewarded me with long oblivion.
Make you me proud and famous as the one
who thought that we can be what Florence was
when angry men made rough rocks beautiful.
