Poor, hapless beast, thus left by all below,
Amongst the noblest of God's creatures, thou,
    Once free from pain,
    Didst trip the plain;
But Oh! how much thy case is altered now!

Thy groom and master seem to stand aloof!
Is it, because of thee they've had enough?
    Is it respect,
    Or sheer neglect,
That of their care thou hast no stronger proof?

Perhaps they do not Like to hear or see
Thy last deep groan, thy dying agony!
    The grass upspurn'd,
    Thine eye upturned,
