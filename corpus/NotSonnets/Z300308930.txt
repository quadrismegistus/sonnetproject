Give Lucinda Pearl, nor Stone,
Lend them light who else have none,
Let Her beautis shine alone.

Gums nor spice bring from the East,
For the Phenix in Her breast
Builds his funeral pile, and nest.

No Tyre thou canst invent,
Shall to grace her form be sent,
She adorns all ornament.

Give Her nothing, but restore
Those sweet smiles which heretofore,
In Her cheerful eyes she wore.

Drive those envious clouds away,
Vailes that have overcast my day,
