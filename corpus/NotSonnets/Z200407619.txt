Halleluja to the Lord on high,
    All glory, honour, praise
Ascribe to him continually,
    And live to him always.

Lift Christ on high, our glorious King,
    In whom all fullness dwells;
He is our Life and Fountain-spring,
    His glory great excels.

'Tis Christ, O God, that we do preach,
    As thou dost us command;
O let thy Word Men's hearts so reach,
    It may break Satan's Band.

O set their Souls at liberty,
    And them unite to thee,
