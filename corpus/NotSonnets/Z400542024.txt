Praise Him, you Servants of that' Eternal King,
        To God your noblest Praises sing,
And make Heavens vault with the loud Echo ring!
        Praise Him, all you, who fear his Name,
        And over that' Expanse his Lauds proclaim;
Both great and small in tuneful Shouts accord,
And with one Heart and Voice adore our Lord!
        Hallelujah! Sing aloud!
        Louder still that' harmonious Voice,
        Till it drown a Thunders Noise,
And with gay Horror fill that' admiring Crowd!
For (Lo!) our God Omnipotent does Reign,
And to himself resumes the Rule again.
    Let us be glad now, and let us rejoice,
