The war-note of the Saracen
        Was on the winds of France;
        It had stilled the harp of the Troubadour,
    And the clash of the tourney's lance.

The sounds of the sea, and the sounds of the night,
And the hollow echoes of charge and flight,
Were around Clotilde, as she knelt to prey
In a chapel where the mighty lay,
    On the old Proven√ßal shore;
Many a Chatillon beneath,
Unstirr'd by the ringing trumpet's breath,
    His shroud of armour wore.
And the glimpses of moonlight that went and came
Through the clouds, Like bursts of a dying flame,
