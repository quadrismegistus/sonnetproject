Why was this blooming spray entwined
    In fresh festoons of grace,
Around this inmost heart to wind
    And all its love embrace?
O that upon my troubled head
    Had come this mighty blow
That numbers her among the dead,
    Thou Author of my woe!
Link not another's fate to thine
    Beyond the hour allowed,
Nor in thy troubled heart repine
    Though low by sorrow bowed:
Look only in thy chamber lone
    To emulate the grace
