Who would not wish a poet's holy name; -- 
Still more a poet's empire than his fame?
Ask you the test that proves the genuine strain; -- 
If the tide flows from and undoubted vein?
Let the heart tell, if when the drink is first
In sparkling murmurs offered to the thirst,
The trembling glow its arteries attest;
And the brain fires, and swells the kindling breast!
If such the spell, though critics ply their taste,
And all their chemic arts in censure waste,
From fount of Helicon the stream proceeds,
And justly claims the poet's laureate meeds.
Not narrow is the poet's theme, nor bound
His means of pleasure to a narrow ground:
