Howard! whose eagle-genius soars above
    The weak enervate flight of modern rhymes;
Whose bosom, glowing with thy country's love,
    Curbs the wild frenzy of distempered times.

Whether those sacred heights thy fancy climbs,
    Where memory's maids round Shakspeare's temple rove,
Or, deeply shuddering at a nation's crimes,
    Her sluggard sons you waken and reprove.

Complete thy generous toil -- lo! fame pursues,
        Her golden trump, her laurel wreathe she brings,
    To crown with deathless praise thy various worth;
Though rancorous envy the fair palm refuse,
        'Tis virtue's tax; for true the poet sings,
    "It is the bright day brings the adder forth."
