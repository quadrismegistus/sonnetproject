The leprosy if physic been approved,
    Achilles cure, because Achilles loved:
The leprosy (says Gordon) a disease,
    Which on the child as yet unborn does seize,
Infectious and contagious, I could prove
    It is incurable, and so is love.
Loves leprosy, according to her kind,
    Made him a leaper in a lovers mind.
Troy lost his soldier, Priam lost a son,
Troye's Hope's were passed, and Priam's triumphs done.
The Phrygian dams, those sad Illyades,
Earth spherifying lights, heaven's Pleiades,
Do fret the pavement of his brazen tomb
With tears, whose currants from their eyelids run,
