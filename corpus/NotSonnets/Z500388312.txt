The ills we see, -- 
    The mysteries of sorrow deep and long,
    The dark enigmas of permitted wrong, -- 
        Have all one key:
    This strange, sad world is but our Father's school;
All chance and change His love shall grandly overrule.

        How sweet to know
    The trials which we cannot comprehend
    Have each their own divinely-purposed end!
        He traineth so
    For higher learning, ever onward reaching
For fuller knowledge yet, and His own deeper teaching.

        He traineth thus
    That we may teach the lessons we are taught;
