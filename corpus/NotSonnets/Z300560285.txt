The cormorant, commissar of the hard sea,
Has not adjusted to the soft river.

He lifts his pterodactyl head in the drought pool
(Sound-proof cellar of final solutions).

The dinosaur massacre-machine
Hums on in his skull, program unaltered.

That fossil eye-chip could reduce
All the blood in the world, yet still taste nothing.

At dawn he's at it, under the sick face -- 
Cancer in the lymph, uncontrollable.

Level your eye's aim and he's off
Knocking things over, out through the window -- 

An abortion-doctor
Black bag packed with vital organs
