Hail, genial Autumn! On that' horizon clear
Thine outlines rise, fair Harbour of the Year;
As the white cliffs, seen faintly over the foam,
To wave-worn sailors promise rest at home;
Season not only felt by tree and flower,
The Man, the State, the Muse, confess thy power,
Each owns thy influence. Not to thee belong
The youth of Spring, the burst of lyric sung,
Nor all the blended harmonies that tune
The softened strength of Manhood's summer noon:
Yet though the fire must sink; though now are gone
The flowers that once in Fancy's garden shone;
Though the heart leap not to the amorous dance,
And visionary dream of young Romance;
