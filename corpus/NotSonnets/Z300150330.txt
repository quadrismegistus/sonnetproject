The evil days have come, the poor
    Are made a prey;
Bar up the hospitable door,
Put out the fire-lights, point no more
    The wanderer's way.

For Pity now is crime; the chain
    Which binds our States
Is melted at her hearth in twain,
Is rusted by her tears' soft rain:
    Close up her gates.

Our Union, Like a glacier stirred
    By voice below,
Or bell of kine, or wing of bird,
A beggar's crust, a kindly word
