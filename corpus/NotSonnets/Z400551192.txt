Mountains and seas
Birl under his wings
Till a' gaes in a kink
O' skimmerin' rings.

He lays on with' his sang,
The wully we chap,
Till he gars earth bizz
Like a dozened tap.

Syne he hings sidelins
Watchin' ho Long
It takes' till it staggers
Oot oh' his sang.

Aye it takes' langer
And ane oh' thane days
