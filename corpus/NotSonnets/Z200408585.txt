'Tis only the nightingale's warbled strain,
    That floats through the evening sky:
With his note of love, he replies again,
    To the muezzin's holy cry;
As it sweetly sounds on the rosy air,
"Allah ill allah! come to prayer!"
Warm over the waters the read sun is glowing,
'Tis the last parting glance of his splendour and might,
While each rippling wave on the bright shore is throwing
Its white crest, that breaks into showers of light.
Each distant mosque and minaret
Is shining in the setting sun,
Whose farewell look is brighter yet,
Than that with which its course begun.
