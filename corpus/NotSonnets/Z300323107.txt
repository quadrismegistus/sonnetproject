O God, whose favourable eye
    The sin-sick soul revives,
Holy and heavenly is the joy
    Thy shining presence gives.

Not such as hypocrites suppose,
    Who with a graceless heart
Taste not of thee, but drink a dose
    Prepared by Satan's art.

Intoxicating joys are theirs,
    Who while they boast their light,
And seem to soar above the stars,
    Are plunging into night.

Lull'd in a soft and fatal sleep,
    They sin and yet rejoice;
