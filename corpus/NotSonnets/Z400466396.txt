Unloose your heart, and let me see
What's hid within that ruby round;
Let every fold be now unbound.
What's here? Belief? -- impiety?
Good -- bade -- indifferent? Let them be.

I see the crude half-finished thought;
The scrambling fancies, one by one,
Come out and stretch them in the sun.
And what's that in the distance, wrought,
Clear, round, prismatic? -- It is nought, -- 

A bubble, swollen to its best,
Its largest shape; yet overmuch.
'Twill shrink, I fancy, at a touch:
Yet, I'll not touch it: -- Let it rest,
