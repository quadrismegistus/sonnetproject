Go, triflers with God's secret. Far, o far
    Be your thin monotone, your brows flower-crowned,
Your backward-looking faces; for you mar
    The pregnant time with silly sooth of found,
    With flowers around the feverish temples bound,
And withering in the close air of the feast.
    Take all the summer pleasures you have found,
While Circe-charm'd you turn to bird and beast.
    Meantime I sit apart, a lonely wight
On this bore rock amid this fitful Sea,
    And in the wind and rain I try to light
A little lamp that may a Beacon be,
    Whereby poor ship-folk, driving through' the night,
May gain the Ocean-course, and think of me!
