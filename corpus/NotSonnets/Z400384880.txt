Thou Newter Gender! whom a gown
Can make a woman, Breeches none:
Created one thing, made another,
Not a Sister, scarce a Brother:
Jack of both sides, that may bear
Or a distaff or a spear,
If thy Fortune's thither call,
Be the Gran Signor's general,
Or if thou fancy not that trade,
Turn th'Sultana's Chamber-maid;
A Medall where grim Mars turned right
Proves a smiling Aphrodite;
How does Nature quibble either
He, or she, Boy, Girle, or neither;
