When ripening Virtue soon in Youth appears,
And Wit exerts it self above it's Years,
'Tis a sure Omen they've not long to stay;
Just shown to raise our Wonder and away!
Those Blessings soonest go that most delight,
And forward Plants but rarely escape the Blight.

But though' the Innocent thus early leave
Their Friends below, we should not vainly grieve:
Reason immoderate Sorrow does reprove,
Shews we that Way but misapply our Love,
For Innocence has better Friends above.

If then the Vertu'ous once will have Reward,
Why should we think their early Summons hard?
The Just are never taken unprepared.
