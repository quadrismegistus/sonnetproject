Words are Dear Lord, notes insignificant
    But Curled air when spoke Sedan'd from the Lip
Into the Eare, soon vanish, though don't Cant,
    Yea run on tiptoe, and hence often trip
    Sometimes do poother out Like th'Chimny Smoake
    Hence often smut the matter, and nigh Choake.

Hence, my Dear Lord, the mantle I would make
    Thee, I do fear will run all Counter buff,
To my design, and streaked be Like a Snake,
    That's new crept out of 'ts garment, a slunk Slough,
    Or have a smoky Smell, and Choaky lodge
    Within its Clasp. And so it prove a blodge.

But, o Dear Lord, though my pen pikes no gold
    To lace these robes with, I would dress thee in
