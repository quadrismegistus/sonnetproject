The Lion, seized with Sickness, took his Bed;
And now the Beasts no more his Fury dread:
They all to him officious Visits pay;
Only misdoubting Reynard kept away.
To him the Prince a Letter Missive sent,
With Invitations, full of Compliment;
Told him, No Company Like his did please,
Or could so much contribute to his Ease;
Pray'd him to come, and bid him fear no Harm;
For now his Weakness did his Rage disarm.
The Fox returned; He wished his royal Health,
With long increase, alike, of Years, and Wealth;
For which with Heav'n he all his Int'rest used;
But, for a Visit, prayed to be excused:
