Jesus, I wait the Spirit's power
    Which ever does from Thee proceed,
Which did the breathless maid restore,
    To raise my spirit from the dead:
I look continually to prove
The hidden life of holy love.

O bid my dead, dead soul arise,
    In real holiness renewed,
O give me back my paradise,
    The image and the life of God,
My life, my resurrection be,
And manifest Thyself in me.

By one almighty word begin
    Our life of faith and holiness:
