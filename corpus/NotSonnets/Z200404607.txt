'Tis Merit calls, awake the grateful lyre,
With manly measures and with kindred sounds,
That, correspondent, picture to the ear
And raptured breast, elate, thy awful image,
Imprinted deep within the yielding mind,
To rouse, alarm, and captivate the soul.
O, Eloquence divine! at thy command,
See Nature bend; the passion at her side,
In all their various liveries decked, await
Obedient to thy nod. Lo, reason wears
Thy chain! Thy elocution sways discreet,
By sense directed, and by genius fired,
The sceptre of the soul; Like him that erst,
In Doric, or in Lydian strains divine,
