A Country Clown called Hodge, went up to view
The Pyramid; prey mark what did ensue.

When Hodge had numbered up how many score
The Airy Pyramid contained, he swore,
No Mortal Wight ever Climb'd so high before:
To the best vantage placed he views around
The Imperial Town, with lofty Turrets Crown'd;
That wealthy Store-house of the bounteous Flood,
Whose Peaceful Tides overflow our Land with good:
Confused forms flit by his wondering Eyes,
And his rapt Souls overwhelmed with Extasies:
Some God it seems had entered his plain Breast,
And with's abided the rustic Mansion blessed;
Almighty change he feels in every part,
