Now pants the night-breeze through' the darkened air,
And Silence sooths the vestal world to rest,
Save where some pale-eyed novice (rapt in prayer)
Heaves a deep moan, and smites her guiltless breast.

Within those ancient walls with moss overspread,
Where Grief and Innocence their vigils keep,
Each in her humble cell till midnight laid,
The gentle daughters of Devotion sleep.

Of Wantonness the pleasure-breathing lay,
Or Laughter beckoning from his rosy seat,
Or Vanity attired in colours gay,
Shall never allure them from their sober state.

Domestic comforts they shall never know,
Nor voice of kindred reach their distant ear:
