And I remember yet another day.
One afternoon I saw a gypsy girl
sitting on the green grass at a meadow's edge,
just by herself, doing her hair in a plait.
Her pet puppy came behind her, took
the movement of the hair to be some sport,
and jumping high and barking loudly, began
to bite the moving plait again and again.
The girl shook her neck and told him off,
which only increased the puppy's playful mood.
She gave him a little rap with her forefinger;
he took it for more play, God more excited.
Laughing then, she God up, drew him to her breast
and smothered him with cuddles.
