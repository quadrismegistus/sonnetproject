Look, lovely maid, on yonder flower,
    And see that busy fly,
Made for the enjoyment of and hour,
    And only born to die.

See, round the rose he lightly moves,
    And wantons in the sun,
His little life in joy improves,
    And lives, before 'this gone.

From this instinctive wisdom, learn,
    The present hour to prize;
Nor leave today's supreme concern,
    'Till morrow's morn arise.

Say, louliest fair, canst thou divine
    That morrow's hidden doom?
