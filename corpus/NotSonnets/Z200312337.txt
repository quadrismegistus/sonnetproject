The time hath been, a boyish, blushing time,
When modesty was scarcely held a crime;
When the most wicked had some touch of grace,
And trembled to meet Virtue face to face;
When those, who, in the cause of Sin grown grey,
Had served her without grudging, day by day,
Were yet so weak and awkward shame to feel,
And strove that glorious service to conceal:
We, better bred, and than our sire's more wise,
Such paltry narrowness of soul despise:
To virtue every mean pretence disclaim,
Lay bore our crimes, and glory in our shame.

Time was, ere Temperance had fled the realm,
Ere Luxury sat guttling at the helm
