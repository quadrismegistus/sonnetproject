Let age-dry'd Ã†son Sacrifice
To Sol, and he whose weather-wise
Autumnine joints at every blast
Of Boreas keener Breath are cast
Into a Palsy, and do find
As much ado to stand i'th' wind
And frost, as the thatched should, which he
Erected in's Minority.
And let Amyntas, and the Swain
Whose Soul is corn, and Hope the gain
That the kindly-ripening Springs
And Golden-headed Harvest brings,
    Evry Yeer
    An Altar rear
