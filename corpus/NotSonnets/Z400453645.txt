Assume your dignity
Among forgotten tombs!
Now that the mind assumes
Thoughtlessness of despair,
And crazed our eyeballs stare
As ancient statues who,
Once appareled in light,
Untoppled amid columns
Falling, stood and unmoved
Saw in the shards below
Smoke the throats of their sons -- 
Into your unloved night
Accept this elegy.
This is the son you loved.
