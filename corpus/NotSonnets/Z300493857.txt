Wreck'd Palace! where, confusedly joined,
Sad emblem of thy master's mind,
The Roman and the Goth hath lent
Forms of discordant ornament:

Half buried in Oblivion's tomb:
Yet, might lay Like mine prevail,
Thy dust should live, and spread the tale,
And call from Pleasure's festive round
A Briton's foot to haunt that ground.

That Palace -- was Rienzi's home -- 
Rienzi -- pride, and scorn of Rome:
