Sweet Robin Burns, freak nature's wanton child,
    Whene'er I ken thy simple artless page,
I feel my breast to melt with pity mild,
    Or glowing burn with passion's fervent rage.

So tender and expressive is thy tale,
    So unassuming, free from school-taught pride;
To rouse the noble breast thou never wilt fail,
    So much with freedom's voice is thine allied.

In every verse some beauty meets my eye,
    In every line soft music steals along:
Those native charms before me open lie,
    So sweetly sung by thee, thou child of sung!

With thee on banks of "bonny Doon" I stray,
    With thee from hills, and yellow fields among,
