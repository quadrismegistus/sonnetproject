Love, Love I fly thy power, my fearful heart
How she may prove arms me against thy Dart;
And though I'm ignorant the Knowing say,
Thy Courtiers have more toilsome Cares then Play;
Therefore I'll hug my Cave, and Live alone,
And love my Self better for loving none.

For what is Love, but th'Brat of found Conceit,
    Business, of Idleness a very Cheat?
They pay's our dreamed Eliziums, minutes Joys,
    With years of perverse Humours, Fear a noise:
Then welcome Cave, where Prayers and Tears shall prove
My active Business for Celestial Love.

Here calmly pensive pious Thoughts shall be
    With my good Angel, my choice Company
