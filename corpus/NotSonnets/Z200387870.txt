Soorrow betide my sins! Must smart so soon
Seaze on my Saviours tender flesh, scarce grown
    Unto and eight days age?
    Can nothing else assuage
The wrath of heaven but his infant blood?
Innocent infant, infinitely good!

Is this thy welcome to the world, great God:
No sooner born but subject to the rod,
    Of sin incensed wrath?
    Alas! what pleasure hath
Thy Fathers justice to begin thy passion
Almost together with thine incarnation?

Is it to antedate thy death? Indite
Thy condemnation himself? and write
