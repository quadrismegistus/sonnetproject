Whither, my Heart, do You your Flight prepare?
    Make You a Visit to the Matchless Fair?
        Thither the Heedless Wanton flies,
    Ambitious to be ruined by Her Eyes:
To meet their Shafts Impatient Lovers run,
And proudly All contend to be undone.

Well -- since You will be gone, -- to Madness gaze
On the Transcendent Glories of Her Face;
    Then trembling view each Colder Part,
Her Snowy Bosom, and Her Icy Heart:
        Thro' all the various Regions move,
And wander over that Beauteous World of Love.

    But O! I caution Thee, avoid with Care
    The flowing Tresses of Her Auborn Hair.
