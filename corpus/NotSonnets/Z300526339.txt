Hark, hark! 'this a voice from the tomb,
    "Come, mourner," it cries, "come away!
The grave of thy children has room
    To rest thee beside their cold clay:
Thy burden of sorrow lay down,
    Escape to the harbour so nigh;
Thy course of affliction is run,
    And Mercy permits thee to die!"

The hope of a sudden release,
    The token for good I receive,
The blissful assurance of peace,
    Which Jesus is ready to give:
It reaches a soul in the deep,
    It points to that heavenly shore;
