Dreaming! idly dreaming!
    In the summer bowers,
Came a whisper stilly,
From the rose and lily
    And the meadow flowers: -- 
"Though we bloom to woo you,"
    Seem'd the voice to sighs,
"Leave, o, leave us growing,
"Or, Like wild-winds blowing,
    "Touch, and travel by!
"Beauty shrinks from selfish capture,
"Love is short that lives on rapture;
    "If you gather us, we die!"

Waking! sadly waking!
