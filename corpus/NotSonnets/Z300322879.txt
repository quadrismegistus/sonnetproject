Chear up my Mates, the wind does fairly blow,
    Clap on more sail and never spare;
    Farewell all Lands, for now we are
    In the wide Sea of Drink, and merrily we go.
Bless me, 'this hight! another bowl of wine,
    And we shall cut the Burning Line:
Hey Boyes! she scuds away, and by my head I know,
    We round the World are sailing now.
What dull men are those who tarry at home,
When abroad they might wantonly room,
    And gain such experience, and spy too
    Such Countries, and Wonders as I do?
But prithee good Pilot take heed what you do,
    And fail not to touch at Peru;
