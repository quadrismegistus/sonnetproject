WHISPERING SLEEP
Are not thy lips of honey, thy breath of honeysuckle,
    Brother sweet of the breeze, wooing and whispering Sleep?
Soft at our ears Like a lover's thy vague lips tenderly murmur
    "Kiss me!" they seem to say, "give me, poor heart, but a kiss."
Then our anguish dims, care fades with the fading lattice;
    Into a lovely land wander we all unawares!
O, into what sweet land didst thou this hour bewitch me?
    Wakeful, in tears, I lay, thinking of her who is dead,
Wishing, longing for her, my heart's beloved, who left me -- 
    Left me, and never once turned to regard me again.
Never then shall I see a soft face over me leaning,
    Feel a gentle hand touching me, never again!
Those adorable ways I now must only remember,
