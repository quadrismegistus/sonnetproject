He looks beyond the veils of night and day;
    He hearkens in the silence, and has herd
    The ancient woods by dryad singing stirred,
To mortal ears how thin and far away.
With what gross laughter yet he turns to play
    With slaves of vice and virtue and the heard
    Of flopping little Calibans, that gird
At muddy boots and call them feet of clay.

Here you may loaf the valley or breast the hill,
    Dive deep for pearl or sink your shaft for gold,
        Or watch Love, laughing, flit in the summer nights.
Fit by the mud and sniff it as you will,
    If you but lift your eyes and inch, behold
        The moving tide and broken glimmer of lights.
