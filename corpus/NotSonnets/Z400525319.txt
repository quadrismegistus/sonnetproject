Jesus, life-inspiring Saviour,
    Life's continual Nourisher,
How have we abused Thy favour,
    Rashly feeding without fear,
Fondly our own souls ensnaring
    By the gifts Thy grace bestowed,
Nothing for the Giver caring,
    Poisoning all our pleasant food.

But Thy love hath taught us better;
    Ransom'd now from sensual thrall,
Thee we find in every creature,
    Thee we sweetly taste in all;
Pure delight from Thee receiving,
    We these outward blessings share,
