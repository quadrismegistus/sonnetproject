'Tis true, I am undone; Yet ever I die,
I'll leave these sighs, and tears a Legacy
To after-Lovers; that remembering me,
Those sickly flames which now benighted be,
Fann'd by their warmer sighs may love; and prove
In them the Metempsuchosis of Love.
'Twas I (when others scorned) vowed you were fair,
And sware that breath enriched the courser air,
Lent Roses to your cheeks, made Flora bring
Her Nymphs with all the glories of the Spring
To wait upon thy face, and gave my heart
A pledge to Cupid for a quicker dart,
To arm those eyes against my self; to me
Thou owest that tongues bewitching harmony:
