O Sweet Society!
    What is living without thee?
    Solitude hath oft and long
    Been the theme of poet's sung:
        And charming solitude
    Is exquisitely fair and good;
    But never, never without thee,
Best boon of heaven, O sweet Society!
    She too, she shall have the praise
    Of my rude, unlabour'd lays:
    But never to disparage her,
    Elder-born, and fairer far,
        Divine Society!
    First, best boon of bounteous heaven,
