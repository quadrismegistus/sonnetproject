I blaze that star, which was no blazing star,
But the true figure of eternal life,
The prince of peace was born then ceased war,
His births beginning ended mortal strife,
This glorious star did led the aged wise
To worship th'Infants Godhead in the East,
Which came with gladsome heart & joyful eyes,
To see that Babe that made all Israell blessed:
O light of Heaven thou wast extinct on earth,
Yet to our souls Celestial life does give
Thy death our life, thy rising our new birth
Thou three days dead didst make us ever live,
    Yet at thy death obscured was earth and sky,
    Because he that was God, as man did die.
