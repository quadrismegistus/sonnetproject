In Lagos, the arms of rancid women in tin shacks,
dung and drunkenness, the moon's white stain
and starlight twinkling on the teeth of a native,
mouth open, gurgling in a ditch -- 
the voyage has come to that.
Then morning, a mammy sashays to market,
the fluted jug on her head, round and full
as her body brimming over, the living sun.
Night, the engines drumming
a highlife below deck, move the shining stevedores
to flex and free what awaited them
in the thicket of the dance, giving in
as though and easy ecstasy always within reach
might open a circle and nature, drunkenly big-hearted,
