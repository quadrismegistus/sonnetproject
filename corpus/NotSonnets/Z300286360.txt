While you with Atticus enjoy the Praise,
By all distinguished, every Side to please;
While Parties join your Merit to commend,
And every honest Man must be your Friend:
Forgive the Muse who would her Homage pay,
And to your View submit the faithful Lay;
Who, conscious of the Joys you most approve,
Seeks you, retired, within your favourite Grove:

On Esca's Bank,  [Footnote: 1Kb] where, with melodious Sound,
The Thrush responsive charms the Shades around:
Where free from public Cares, and City-Noise,
Your Mind the Sweets of Solitude enjoys!
Where pure and undisturbed your Blessings flow,
As Heav'n seemed pleased its Favours to bestow;
