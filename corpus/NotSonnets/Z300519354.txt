I had a vision of a fountain fair
Whose home was heaven, whose path the purple air;
It clove a mountain's living heart, and fell
Soft as the snow, sweet as a silver bell,
Throughout all space and time for ever on
By laughing lea and pillared Parthenon,
And green green valley where the golden grape
Drew in the summer and took hue and shape
Mid read rose maidens white; for ever down,
By stony step, and black tormented town
At evil strife where angry figures reared
Rebellious brows of hate and disappeared,
Through solitude of sullen waste and smoke
Of countless peoples that as billows broke
