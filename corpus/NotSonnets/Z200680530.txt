I have that in me
That sooner, or in later years, will out;
    Idlesse may win me
To waste good hours -- I may be clogged with doubt
    Or cloyed with pleasure;
Or weary with a burden of despair,
    Or lulled with leisure
To sleep; or by unintermittent care
    Hawk'd at and hunted;
Or by the deadening round of daily toil
    Worn thin and blunted;
Or by the promise of a richer spoil,
    My goal forgotten,
Used for a baser purpose; or, with lust
