MANHOOD.
Still onward goes the bark -- the tide
Bears it along where breakers foam and roar,
And oaks unbending, riven, line the shore;
Dense vapours rising, all the future hide;
And how shall be that fearful peril bide?
The guiding helm he eager grasps no more;
Time weighs the prow, the wave is deep beside;
Swift flows the current, fierce the gathering strife,
The struggle and the buffetings of life.
Half he recoils, yet calmly bides the test,
With hands clasped firmly on the unconquered breast;
Nor meets alone that hour with peril rife;
Forth from on high the guardian Spirit bends
