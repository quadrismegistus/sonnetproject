Pure as gale and missed washing my skull
pure as silk dances on the ocean's knee
thong thighs of the walking coast
pure as Mendocino witch havens
through the transparent plumes of extinct birds
looking down from the sky-people boat
exploding over candy castles
the salt wisdom pervades
safe as the mummy's purity is from the congresses of fear

The night goes up
into the ventricles of King Novalis
and horned men descend the saline stairway
whose bones are lit up from astral lamps
of the great genii, Ignis phana, pure claw
