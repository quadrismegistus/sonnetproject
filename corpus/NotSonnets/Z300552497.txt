Midmorning, September, and read tractors climb
on a landscape wide as all forgiveness. Clouds
in the west horizon, parrots twinkling down
on Leary's oats, on Stewarts' upturned field -- 

good friends are blood relations that you choose.
The phrase discovers me in the heart of farmland
harpstringing fences, coming back into my life.
A thick coin flips out of my mouth, I leap over thistles

and I think of your wedding, I make it shine among trees
in a vast evening cattlecamp lit by jeweled pendants, by Plataeae,
by brass lamps suspended on trace chains at great height.
The beams of carlights conjure our bustling assembly.

Now the minister comes, with rapid changes of car,
and all of us, painters, centurions in mufti, horses,
