Free is the Student! thus they sing,
    Their glasses all resounding;
Freedom, the fairest, noblest thing,
    And here alone abounding!

So little birds may be alleged
    Quite free at nestling ages;
But when King Fred believes you fledged,
    You'll soon be clapped in cages.

So sucking bears are left alone,
    To run about unguarded;
But when the rascals' teeth are grown,
    They must be chained and warded.

Thus you that scorn a slave's estate
    Shall find you've but delayed it:
