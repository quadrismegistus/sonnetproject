See, Silvia, see the sparkling Lamp of Day;
From our found Eyes he draws the trembling Ray:
The curling Clouds pursue his shortening Beams,
And catch new Colours from the parting Gleams:
From marshy Vales unhealthy Fogs arise,
And gloomy Vapours fill the mourning Skies.
A creeping Mist overspreads the silent Field,
And drooping Flow'rs their Ev'ning Incense yield.
On every Leaf the pearly Drops appear,
And Nature weeps and universal Tear.

    So will it be when those fair Suns of thine,
By Fate eclipsed, their cheerful Beams resign:
When the just Heavens remand their beauteous Store,
And Silvia's Eyes must cheer the World no more:
