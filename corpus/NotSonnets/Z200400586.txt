Put by thy work, dear mother;
    Dear mother come with me,
For I've found within the garden,
    The beautiful sweet-pea!

And rows of stately hollyhocks
    Down by the garden-wall,
All yellow, white, and crimson,
    So many-hued and tall!

And bending on their stalks, mother,
    Are roses white and read;
And pale-stemmed balsams all a-blow,
    On every garden-bed.

Put by thy work, I prey thee,
    And come out, mother dear!
