Lord, we do see that poor we be,
    But thou hast Riches store;
And if that we do come to thee,
    VVe nothing shall want more.

VVhat is our own to us is shown
    Is good, alas, for nought;
O let it go, since we do know
    Rare things are to be bought:

And thou dost cry, O come and buy!
    O blessed be the Lord!
Now is the day, let's not delay,
    But close in with thy Word:

Then rich shall we for ever be,
    And Crowns of Glory have;
