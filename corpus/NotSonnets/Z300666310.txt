On the blue summer hills, under a vine,
    Leave me to dream of the Forms that around them
Piped leafy melodies, pressed the read wine,
    And garlanded lutes for the Satyrs to found them.
Up from the gloom of the forested valley,
    Where the first planet is glimmering paly,
Leaving the nymph group to dance and to dally,
    One through the flowers is wandering gaily.
White-bearded, rosy-eyed, hoofed at the limb,
    Under one hairy arm clutching a cymbal;
While on his slender horns, pointed and prim,
    He settles the ivy-wreath airily nimble.
Now to a Plate of acanthus he's come,
    And stretching at length, on the low gloaming gazes;
