In this cold Monument lies one,
That I know who has lain upon,
The happier He: her Sight would charm,
And Touch have kept King David warm.
Lovely, as is the dawning East,
Was this Marble's frozen Guest;
As soft, and Snowy, as that Down
Adorns the Blow-balls frizzled Crown;
As straight and slender as the Crest,
Or Antlet of the one beamed Beast;
Pleasant as that' odorous Month of May:
As glorious, and as light as Day.

Whom I admired, as soon as knew,
And now her Memory pursue
