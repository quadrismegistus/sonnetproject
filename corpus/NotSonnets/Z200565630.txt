In the delicately shrouded heart
Of this white rose, a patient eye,
The eye of love,
Knows who I am, and where I've been
Tonight, and what I wish I'ld done.

I have been watching this white rose
For hours, imagining
Each tremor of each petal to be Like a breath
That silences and sooths.
'Look at it,' I'ld say to you
If you were here: 'it is a sign
Of what is brief, and lonely
And in love.'

But you have gone and so I'll call it wise:
