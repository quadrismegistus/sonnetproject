Happy soul, thy days are ended,
    All thy mourning days below:
Go, by angel guards attended,
    To the sighed of Jesus go!
Waiting to receive thy spirit,
    Lo! the Saviour stands above,
Shows the purchase of His merit,
    Reaches out the crown of love.

Struggle through thy latest passion
    To thy dear Redeemer's breast,
To His uttermost salvation,
    To His everlasting rest:
For the joy He sets before thee,
    Bear a momentary pain,
