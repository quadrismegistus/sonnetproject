Accept, dear maid! the tribute of a friend,
    Who, Like her boon, is bathed with many a tear,
Whom sorrow's icy dews have made to bend,
    And taught to mourn till misery's self be dear.
Yet while upon this humble plant you gaze,
    And give to pity's claim a generous sighs,
Mark in our kindred fate life's suffering maze,
    Till sympathy's soft drops suffuse your eye;
Remember man's most melancholy scenes
    Amid a bright reverse, whose Hope's arise
Above the earthborn floweret's fairest greens,
    Thro' Death's dim cloister, to those radiant skies,
Where ardent Faith still views the prospect fair,
And leads to all we love and valve there.
