Cease, cease, that vain and useless scorn,
    Or save it for the Slaves that die;
I in your Flames no longer burn,
    No more the whining Fool you fly;
    But all your Cruelty defy.

My Heart your Empire now disdains,
    And Frown, or Smile, all's one to me:
The Slave has broke his Servial Chains,
    And spite of all your Pride is free
    From the Tyrannick Slavery.

Be kind or cruel every day,
    Your Eyes may wear what dress they please,
'Twill not affect me either way,
    How my found Heart has found its Peace,
