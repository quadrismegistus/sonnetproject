About the well which from mine eyes did flow,
The woeful witness of hearts desolation:
Yet tears nor woe nor aught could work compassion,
Did diverse trees of sundry nature's grow.
The myrrh sweet bleeding in the latter wound,
Into the crystal waves her tears did power:
As pitying me on whom blind love did lower,
Upon whose back I wrote my sorrows ground.
And on her rugged rind I wrote forlorn,
Forlorn I wrote for sorrow me oppressed:
Oppressing sorrow had my heart distressed,
And made the abject outcast of loves scorn,
The leaves conspiring with the winds sweet sounding,
With gentle murmor plained my hearts deep wounding.
