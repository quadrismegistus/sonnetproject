What "blushing Hippocrene" is here! what fire
Of the "warm South" with magic of old Spain! -- 
Through which again I seem to view the train
Of all Cervantes' dreams, his heart's desire:

Impossible quests, -- following a deathless dream
Of righted wrongs, that never were to be, -- 
Like many another champion who has gone
