My first day down my boss was struck
An' buried by three tons of muck;
'Is butties soon were shovellin' fast
An' reached 'is pulpy 'ead at last;
I stood and' gripped 'is broken pick;
Disgust and' fear sent me sick.

Today Dai Pritchard took 'is yorks
An' 'anged isself by the railway balks;
Will Bet and' me, us cut 'im down,
Then I sent Sergeant there from town,
An' up apast the 'llotments skirted
To tell Dai's widow Dai was 'urted.

I've read a piece of poetry
Of childhood's joys, but can't agree
