Here's no more news, then virtue, 'I may as well
Tell you Calis, or S&supert; Michaels tale for news, as tell
That vice does here habitually dwell.

Yet, as to'get stomachs, we walk up and down,
And toil to sweeten rest, so, may God frown,
If, but to loath both, I haunt Court, or Town.

For here no one is from the'extremitie
Of vice, by any other reason free,
But that the next to'him, still, is worse then he.

In this world's warfare, they whom rugged Fate,
(Gods Commissary,) does so thoroughly hate,
As in'the Courts Squadron to marshal their state.

If they stand armed with Silly honesty,
With wishing prayers, and neat integrity,
