That the Soul must die with the death of its organs,
Is more than mere Physiology can rightly pretend to know.
The inspector of brains and stomachs, in man and in bruit,
By aid of eye and microscope and all the craft of chemistry,
Could never guess that man's brain secreted Intelligence
(As runs the phrase of some physicians) or possessed Free Will;
Nay, or that Man is wiser and nobler than the Ape.
By consciousness and morals this is known to us, not by anatomy.
The grand and glorious science which studies organic forces,
Sweeping into its wide dragnet life's humblest simplest forms,
Is blind to that moral life which lurks in the body unseen;
Nor does comparison of the lowest reveal the powers of the highest.
Free Will is moral life, unknown to the bruit, (as we judge,)
And on Free Will alone rest the pleasant of immortality.
