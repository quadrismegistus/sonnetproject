True poets are they who love all Beauty of soul or scene,
Who make us feel and see whatever they paint, I ween,
Be it lovely or mighty in immortal words set down,
Shaping a nobler life in life lit from their golden crown.
Kings of the mind, creators who bequeathe each human brain,
A world superior to Nature's, wherein they ever reign.
Then let us each day peruse some fancies finer than our own,
With daily matters occupied -- in brightness and in tone,
Those of a richer region seen over some enchanted main,
To keep our souls in the higher light of the universal throne;
Peruse some sung of a soul composed in a happy mood,
In love with its own innocent beauty, that the work may be loved of the good,
Or live with the poets of music, of imaginative found,
When harmonised feeling and fancy filled their spirit's enchanted round.
