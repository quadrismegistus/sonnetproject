Lord, if Thou hast on me bestowed
A master, not humane and good,
    But froward and severe,
Assist the servant of Thy will
With grace and wisdom to fulfil
    The Christian character.

Trampled as dirt beneath his feet,
O may I quietly submit
    To all his stern decrees,
Insults and wrongs in silence bear,
And serve with conscientious care
    Whom I can never please.

Under the galling iron yoke
To Thee my only help I look,
