If hardly once a Quarter of a Year,
So idle grown, a single Sheet appear;
If angry at yourself, that Sleep and Wine
Enjoy your Hours, while anxious to refine
Your Labours passed, no more your Voice you raise
To aught that may deserve the public Praise,
What shall be done? When Saturn's jovial Feast,
Seem'd too luxuriant to your sober Taste,
Hither you fled. Then try the pleasing Strain:
Come on: begin.

Alas! 'this all in vain,
While I with Impotence of Rage abuse
My harmless Pens, the guiltless Walls accuse;
Walls, that seem raised in angry Heaven's Despite,
