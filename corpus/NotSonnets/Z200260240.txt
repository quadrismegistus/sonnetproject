Far, far from thee this heart holds dear,
Methinks I see the glistening tear
    That dimmed thy sparkling eye:
How long must lingering Memory tell
Of that sad hour thou badst farewell,
    How long record each sighs!

Can I forget thy magic charms,
Whilst Love this tender bosom warms,
    And guides my wandering way?
Ah, no! found Memory loves to trace
The graceful from and matchless face
    That did this heart betray.

When dusky Eve steals over the plain,
Gladd'ning the jocund village train,
