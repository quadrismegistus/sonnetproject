Lured by the grateful scent of blood,
With instinct from above endued,
The eagles their commission knew,
To death-devoted Salem flew,
And gathering where the carcase lay,
The Roman hosts devoured their prey.

But lo, a deeper mystery
We in yond sacred Body see!
The bleeding marks of death it bears,
'Tis covered still with glorious scars!
His wounded feet, and hands, and side,
And cross proclaim the Crucified!

Thither the saints shall soon repair
When flames His standard in the air,
