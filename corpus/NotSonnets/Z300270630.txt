It is so strange to think that of ten thousand faces
Thine have I loved and sung. -- The summer wind embraces
        The flowers of all the hills,
And yet it tarries, perhaps, with special love and yearning
Beside some harebell, -- back, and ever backward turning,
    While with deep love the wild wind's dark glance fills.

And God turns back at times from all the tropic blossoms
That with their warm white deep sweet-scented tropic bosoms
        Lure down from heaven the sun
And concentrates his love on English fern, or daisy
Whose gold heart heavenward gleams through English grasses mazy,
    Turns from all other flower-loves, -- loves that one.

For ages through the stars' wild endless complication
God steered his course, -- and through the struggles of each nation
