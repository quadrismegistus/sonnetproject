There was a Bull in Rome was long a breeding,
Which Bull proved little better then a Calfe:
Was sent to England for some better feeding,
To fatten in his Holiness behalf.
The virtues that this Beast of Babel had,
In thundering manner was to ban and curse:
Raile at the Queen, as it were raging mad;
Yet God be thanked She was never the worse.
The goodly Sire of it was Impious Pius.
He taught it learnedly to curse and ban:
And to our faces boldly to defy us.
It madly over England quickly ran:
But what success it had read more and see,
The fruits of it here under written be.
