AT St. Osyth's, near the mill,
    There dwells a lovely lass;
O, had I her good will,
    How sweetly life would pass.

No bold intruding care,
    Our bliss should ever annoy;
Her looks can gild despair,
    And heighten every joy.

Like nature's rural scene,
    Her artless beauty's charm;
Like them with joy serene,
    Our wishing hearts they warm.

Her wit with sweetness crowned,
    Steals every sense away;
