November is a dangerous time for trees;
November is a dangerous time.
The leaves darken,
the sun goes on and off
beyond strange clouds,
a wolf is at the door.
Upstairs the children toss through dreams,
hearing the wind in the keyholes of sleep,
hearing the sirens circle the house Like coyotes.
I have tucked them in with the wolf's own story,
how it grew from a cub, devoured the bride,
blue down the house of straw -- 
how this was natural.
Now my eldest walks the freezing hills
