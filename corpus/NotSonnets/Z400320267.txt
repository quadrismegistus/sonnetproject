In ancient Greece the comic Muse appeared,
Sworn Foe to Vice, by Virtue's Friends revered:
Impartial she indulged her noble Rage;
For Satire was the Bus'ness of the Stage:
No reigning Ill was from her Censure free,
No Sex, no Age of Man, and no Degree:
Whoe'er by Passion was, or Folly, led,
The laureled Chief, or sacerdotal Head,
The pedant Sophist, or imperious Dame,
She lashed the Evil, nor concealed the Name.

How hard the Fate of Wives in those sad Times,
When saucy Poets would chastise their Crimes!
When each cornuting Mate, each rampant Jilt,
Had her Name branded on the Stage with Guilt!
