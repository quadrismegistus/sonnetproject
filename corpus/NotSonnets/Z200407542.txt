If Conscience is become my Friend,
    And cheerfully does speak to me,
And I do to his motions bend,
    No matter though I hated be:

No matter 'this who does revile,
    If Conscience does his witness bear
For us, and does upon us smile,
    Most easy will all things appear.

If Conscience now does give us rest,
    And from all burdens sets us free,
Again we would not be oppressed
    In the old bonds of misery,

For Kingdoms, nor for Crowns of Gold,
    Such inward joy does he afford,
