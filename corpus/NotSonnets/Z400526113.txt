Righteous Lord, Thy people spare!
    Lo! we turn at last to Thee,
Humbly the correction bear
    Of our passed iniquity,
Own the cause of our distress,
Mournfully our sins confess.

We Thy judgments have abhorred,
    We Thy covenant have broke,
Daringly denied our Lord,
    Cast away His easy yoke,
Would not cast our sins away,
Would not know our gracious day.

Therefore is the plague begun,
    Therefore does it still proceed;
