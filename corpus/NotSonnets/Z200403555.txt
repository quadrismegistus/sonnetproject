I'ld have friend reader understand,
All such as fight by sea or land;
Whether they gain the victory,
Or turning tail, from battle flee;
Run sculls 'gainst sense so plump contrary,
They're reared up at same seminary,
And issue forth spick span from school,
The soldier zany -- sailor fool,
Fit lackeys of the fife and drum,
That urge 'em on to kingdom come:
For all who 'tend Bellona's call,
Must needs expect dead march in Saul.

The sons of Mars who curse and swear,
Are under my peculiar care;
