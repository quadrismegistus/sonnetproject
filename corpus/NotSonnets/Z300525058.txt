O Lord, Thou art my Lord, my God,
    Throughout the world I will proclaim
And spread Thy wondrous works abroad,
    And magnify Thy glorious name.

Great are Thy miracles of grace;
    Thee always faithful to Thy word,
Almighty, and all-wise I praise,
    The true, the everlasting Lord.

Thou hast made manifest Thy power,
    Thou hast Thy great salvation shown,
And shook the heaven-invading tower,
    And cast the mighty Babel down.

The city of confusion now
    A nameless heap of ruins lies,
