Now fair and Clear, the Heavens are pleased to Smile;
    The purged Air does rise,
    Full, in her Balm and Spice;
Spiknard and Cassia breath, to reconcile
    Opposed Elements; Aurora fair
    Spreads all the Treasure of her hair,
TO' envite the Active Phebus more away,
And glad the Creatures in a welcome day.

The night is fled, and Daye's best Chorister
    Kickes his feild-Bed with Scorn;
    In lively Rapture, born
To those Etheriall Courts of wonder, where
    His Liricke notes, left filed,
    Preserved are, unsoiled;
