Ioash was good, while his good Unckle reigned,
But when he died, O how was Joash stained
With foul Idolatry; he did inter
Religion in his Unckle's Sepulcher.
We live in the Leass fall; how many taste
Of Heav'nly gifts, yet slink away at last,
A double Lamp, the word and spirit may
Enlighten men, who after fall away
Wholly and finally; Lord! work in me
A thorough-work of grace, let me not be
An Alch'my Christ'an, make me found in heart,
And let not me from thy Statutes depart:
That which does in Hypocrisy begin,
Ends in Apostacy, that hellish sin:
