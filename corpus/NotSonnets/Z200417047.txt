Well -- shall I wish you joy of fame,
That loudly echoes Churchill's name,
And sets you on the Muses' throne,
Which right of conquest made your own?
Or shall I (knowing how unfit
The world esteems a man of wit,
That wheresoever he appears,
They wonder if the knave has ears)
Address with joy and lamentation,
Condolance and Congratulation,
As colleges, who duly bring
Their mess of verse to every king,
Too Å“conomical in taste,
Their sorrow or their joy to waste;
