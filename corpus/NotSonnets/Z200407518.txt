O set thine Image on my Heart!
    O seal it on my Arm!
For Love, Like Death, does cast its Dart,
    And Jealousie is warm.

'Tis Like the Grave, whose keen desire
    Nothing can satisfy;
The Coals thereof ate Coals of Fire
    That flame most vehemently.

Waters can't quench Love's Flames, nor Floods
    The same can ever drown;
If some for Love would give his Goods,
    Despis'd is such and one.

Lord, bear our Name upon thy Breast,
    Engrave it on thy Heart,
