Now hath the ageing year forgotten thee, June,
    And dotes on the MÅ“nad month, October;
How harlot-like she wastes his wealth! How soon
    His gold shall all be gone, and he left sober!
Yet can I not forget thy days of swoon,
    Dear June, at Henley; though the daft disrober
Beat his leaf-tatters all the afternoon
    About me, playing mad to please October.

Still seems the dull day must be brighter there,
    The trees full-leafed, the meadow-grass full green;
        While Thames, here turbid, there steals softly on
A dream of silver, her light boat to bear.
    Yet well I know how changed is that fair scene:
        Or hides it in some mystic Avalon?
