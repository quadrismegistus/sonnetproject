The comical jokes of these comical times,
Shall furnish the theme for my comical rhymes;
For comical folks will have comical fun,
In this comical year 1801. [Footnote: 1Kb]

Our beauxs stuck in boots to their hips, I declare,
Look just Like Cock and Breeches at Bartlemy Fair;
While our bells, in new bonnets, to set off their hair,
First spend all their coal, then the skuttle they wear.

Once fashion decreed that our beaux should be found
In blue and buff uniform all the year round;
Now they think to wear blue when they please is enough,
While, to keep up the charter, our bells dress in buff.

Once our nobles examples of breeding supplied,
And, as lords of rich manors, kept up Britain's pride;
