If thou speakest, though snows surround thee,
    Still the birds believe 'this Spring;
And with transport flutter round thee
    More to listen than to sing!
If thou smilest -- 'this beauty's summer,
    And thou dost misguide the rose; -- 
And the lark, the latest comer,
    Heaven-ward with the mission goes!

If from Nature's golden portal
    Thou bewild'rest nature's own,
How should I, who am but mortal,
    'Scape the witchery of thy tone?
What is Earth if thou forsake it?
    What the seasons unto me?
