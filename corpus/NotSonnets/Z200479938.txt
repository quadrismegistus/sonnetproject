A Marchant lost by shipwreck all he had,
And thereupon he tell distracted mad,
But in the humours of his frantic fits,
He plotted matters did amaze good wits,
As to have plows to go with canvas sails,
And meat well boiled, and sod in wooden pails,
With many matters he did strange, project,
Whereof a number came to some effect,
But a rare voyage came at last in's head,
Should stand the commonwealth in wondrous stead
Only one trade he would undo thereby,
(The Chaundlers he did hate exceedingly)
And therefore (quoth he) to his friends, you know
That every month there does a new Moon grow,
