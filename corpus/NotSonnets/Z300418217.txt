"Sally, Sally, shilly shally,
    Sally, why not name the day?"
"Harry, Harry, I will tarry
    Longer in love's flowery way!"
"Can't you make your mind up, Sally?
    Why embitter thus my cup?"
"Harry, I've so great a mind,
    It takes a long time making up."

"Sally, Sally, in the valley
    You have promised many a time,
On the sunny Sunday morning,
    As we've herd the matin chime.
Heark'ning to those sweet Bells' ringing,
    Calling grateful hearts to prey,
