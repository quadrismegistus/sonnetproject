Who reads a Chapter when to bed,
Shall not have Aches in his head.

Who opes his Purse unto the Poor,
Shall find it filling more and more.

Whose heart and tongue obey God's Word,
Both beats the bush and gets the bird.

Who keeps his thoughts from things amiss,
Is thinking on his way to Bliss.

Who keeps his Conscience pure and clear,
Is always feasting year by year.

Whose stomach does for Dainties crave,
With his own teeth does dig his Grave.

Who loves his Humour to fulfil,
His Humour is himself to kill.
