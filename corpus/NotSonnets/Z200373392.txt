On Scotia's plains, in days of yore,
When lads and lasses tartan wore,
Saft Music rang on ilka shore,
    In hamely weid;
But harmony is now no more,
    And music dead.

Round her the feathered choir would wing,
Sae bonnily she wont to sing,
And sleely wake the sleeping string,
    Their sang to led,
Sweet as the zephyrs of the spring;
    But now she's dead.

Mourn ilka nymph and ilka swain,
Ilk sunny hill and dowie glen;
