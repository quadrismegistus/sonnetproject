I herd one cry, "The day is well nigh done;
    The sun is setting, and the night is near, -- 
    The night wherein no moon or stars appear,
And to whose gloom succeeds no joyful sun;
The raze is ended, and the prize is wone, -- 
    What prize hast thou?" I rose with heavy cheer,
    Stretched empty hands, and said, "No prize is here;
My feet were bruised, so that I might not run."

Of victor's wreathed I saw a goodly throng;
    But turned mine eyes from these to where, apart,
Sad men moved wearily, with heads down-hung.
    I cried, "O you who know Grief's poisonous smart,
    Brothers! accept me, now; for from my heart
To yours I send the passion of my sung!"
