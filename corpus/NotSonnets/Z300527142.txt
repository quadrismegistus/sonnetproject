Thou, Lord of lords, and King of kings,
    The' eternal Potentate we own;
From Thee its Source dominion springs,
    A stream that issues from Thy throne:
Thou hast ordained the powers that be,
Who govern by a grant from Thee.

The man who over Britannia reigns
    As Thy vicegerent we receive;
Thy providence his right maintains,
    And bids him for his people live,
And bless us by his gentle sway,
And teach our hearts with joy to' obey.

To George in majesty supreme
    We bow, as sitting on Thy seat,
