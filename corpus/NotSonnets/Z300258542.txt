Ye Angells bright, pluck from your Wings a Quill.
    Make me a pen thereof that best will write.
Lende me your fancy, and Angellick skill
    To treat this Theme, more rich than Rubies bright.

As in its nutshell bed it snugs fast tide,
    Than any angels pen can glory Cast
    Upon this Drink Drawn from the Rock, tapped by
    The Rod of God, in Horeb, typically.

Sea water strained through Mineralls, Rocks, and Sands
    Well Clarifi'de by Sunbeams, Dulcifi'de,
