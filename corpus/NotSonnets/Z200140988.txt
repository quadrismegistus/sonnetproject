Old England is the only place
Where rudeness counts as no disgrace;
Bold Britons courtesy disdain,
Unless they have some end to gain;
A title though, no matter what,
Can jerk the British hand to hat;
And British voices loud huzzay
Newspaper heroes of the day.
But would you know what truly thrills
Our soul with awe, with wonder fills?
Observe that plain and common man,
Like you or me; gaze while you can.
"Why so?" A solemn whisper sounds, -- 
"He's worth two hundred thousand pounds!"
