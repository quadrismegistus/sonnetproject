Lord, we are Pilgrim's on the Earth,
    As all our Fathers were;
For this is not our dwelling-place,
    No 'biding for us here.

As Pilgrim's go up hill and down,
    And meet with troubles do;
So, Lord, thy Saints, while they are here,
    Do many sorrows know.

A Pilgrim is a Stranger in
    Those places where he lies,
And therefore is not taken with
    Those things which he espies,

Or does behold where he does come:
    What are these things to me?
