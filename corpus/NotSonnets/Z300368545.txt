What if I was soar because I cd not get you
to stay awake for the rain
maybe you herd it, after all,
in yr sleep,
Or if you wd not get up to see
those leaves
asprawl in the moonlight,
a part of the rend -- 
There were still moments
when my life was slick as
and apple atwirl,
as when, after many midnights
of gas and baths
I wd look up and find you
