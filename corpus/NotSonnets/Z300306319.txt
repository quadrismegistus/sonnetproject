First joy through eye and limb
Shoots upward. Groundroots drive
Through shadow and crust a sheath.
I praise God with my breath
As hares leap, fish swim,
And bees bring honey to the hive.

The yew shuts out that sky
And the dumbfounded well
Hides within its stone
The colours' trance; they shone
Pure, but the stones give cry
Answering what no colours spell.

First joy that sinks in the well
Falters to renew,
