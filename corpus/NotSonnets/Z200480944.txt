Yes, venerable chair! I surely prize
Thy massy limbs, thy broad and towering back,
Thy dark unfaded gloss, and carvings quaint,
'Above all the seats that fickle fancy forms
Of daintier trim. The ever-creaking cane,
The light deal tricked with many a gaudy tint,
The tottering, 'broidered stool, and such slim toys,
Are but gay lackeys to thy majesty.
Safe in thy solid sides, I love to roll
My weary limbs -- thy from of antique guise
Flings over my mind a mystic, soothing charm;
And then, in musing mood, I conjure up
The scenes that passed beside thee -- oft thou'st stood
High at the festive board, amid the shouts
