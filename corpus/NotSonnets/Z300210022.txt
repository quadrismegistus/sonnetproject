Never to hear, I know in myself complete
that naked integrated music;      now
it has become me, now it is nerve, sung, gut,
and my gross hand writes only through Mozart;  see
even in withholding what you have brought to me.

Renewed, foolish, reconciled to myself, I walk
this winter-country, I fly over its still-flock'd clouds,
always in my isolated flesh I take
that theme's light certainty of absolute purpose
to make quick spirit when spirit most might break.

Naked you walked through my body and I turned
to you with this far music you now withhold.
O my destroyed hope!    Though I never again
hear developing heaven, the growing grave-bearing earth,
