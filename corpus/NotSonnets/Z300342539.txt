Aonian Sisters help my Phrenes Praise to tell,
Phrene heart of my heart with whom the Graces dwell,
For I surcharged am so soar that I not know
What first to praise of her, her Brest, or Necke of Snow,
Her Cheeks with Roses spread, or her two Sunlike Eies,
Her Teeth of brightest Pearl, her Lips where Svveetnes lies:
But those do praise themselves, being to all Eyes set forth,
That Muses ye needs not to say aught of their Worth,
Then her white sistring Papes essay for to make known,
But her white sistring Papes through smallest Vail are shown,
Yet She hath some thing else more worthy then the rest
Not seen, go sing of that far beneath her Brest
Which mounts Like fair Parnasse, where Pegasse well does run:
    Here Phr√¶ne stayed my Muse ere she had well begun.
