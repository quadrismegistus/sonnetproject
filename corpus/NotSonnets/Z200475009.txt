Not against France we fought at Waterloo,
    But Tyranny -- broad, cosmopolitan,
    Incarnate in the little Corsican,
Who set a world-dominion in his view:
His soul no nation limitation knew -- 
    He sought to hold all nations in his span;
    Europe was but his stance: he was a Man!
And where his spirit flashed his eagles flew!
But who is this before the footlights now,
    That would the bold Napoleon role assume,
        And has not strength to venture "but a pace"?
We know him by his non-imperial brow,
    His whiskers and his scabbard, spurs and plume -- 
        William the Would-Be, vainest of his raze!
