Am not I now in England? Is not this
The Thames? Is not that London? Sure it is.
Me thinks that vast, and ancient structure, there,
Looks just Like Pauls, and that Like Westminster.
Loe, yond is High-gate, yond is Hamsted-mill,
There Bansted-downes, there Kent, there Shooters-hill.
This doubtless is that Country: but why then,
Are here now living so few Englishmen?
Are all those English-men which now I see?
All truebred English-men? the Devil they be.
Indeed I find there are a few among them;
And for their sakes I will not so much wrong them
To say, the Land hath none, within whose veins
The blood of our old Worthies yet remains.
