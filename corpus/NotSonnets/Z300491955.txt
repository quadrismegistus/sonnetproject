I prithee Love take heed
Or else I shall blaspheme,
And swear that thy
Great deity
Is nothing but a dream.

How canst thou be a God
When subtle women's hearts
    Are grown so wise
    To blind thine eyes
And rob thee of thy darts.

See where a Lady stands
With Quivers in her Eyes,
    And swears that she
    Hath conquered thee,
