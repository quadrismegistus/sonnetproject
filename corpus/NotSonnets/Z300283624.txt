I'll tell you all, both great and small,
    I tell you all truly,
That we have cause, and very great cause,
    For to Lament and Cry,
    Fie, Oh! fie, o! fie, o! fie!
    Fie on thee Cruel Death!
    For thou hast taken away from us!
    Our Queen Elizabeth.

Thou mayest have taken other folks,
    That better might be missed,
And have let our Queen alone,
    Who loved no Popish Priest,
    In Peace she ruled all this Land,
    Beholding unto no Man,
