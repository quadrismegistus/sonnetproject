Thomalin my lief, thy music strains to hear,
More raps my soul, then when the swelling winds
On craggy rocks their whistling voices tear;
Or when the sea, if stopped his course he finds,
With broken murmurs thinks weak shores to fear,
Scorning such sandy cords his proud head binds:
    More then where rivers in the summer's ray
    (Through covert glades cutting their shady way)
Run tumbling down the lawns, & with the pebbles play.

Thy strains to hear, old Chamus from his cell
Comes guarded with and hundred Nymphs around;
An hundred Nymphs, that in his rivers dwell,
About him flock with water-lilies crowned:
For thee the Muses leave their silver well,
