After the fabric of heaven, earth, & seas
Were gloriously composed, it then did please
High Iove (ever he began men operation)
To give unto the Angels their creation.
No earthy substance was in them at all,
Their forms were heavenly & spiritual.
Yet some of these, upon the very day
They were by God created (if I say
Vntruth, I can allege mine author for it),
Swelling with pride (o, I to write abhor it)
Because they were such glorious creatures, strove
To take possession of the throne of Iove.
But he, displeased with such ambition,
Struck them with lightning down to Acheron,
