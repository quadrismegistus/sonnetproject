Lord! who may to thy love aspire,
Or hope to join thy heavenly choir,
But he who rests on thee his trust,
Whose thoughts are pure, whose actions just,
Whose word is truth, whose open heart
Disdains the mean disguise of art,
Who, swift to praise, as slow to blame,
Guards as his own his neighbour's fame.
Despising earthly pomp and state,
He knows the good alone are great,
If Danger wakes, or Justice sleeps,
Alike, if given, his word he keeps.
No gains luxurious swell his hoard,
No guiltless blood embrues his sword,
