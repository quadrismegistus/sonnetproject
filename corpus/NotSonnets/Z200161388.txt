Come you who love our cause,
Whose hearts for freedom's laws,
    With rapture glow.
Come join our noble band,
Be with us heart and hand,
To save our happy land
    From sin and woe.

Come you who quaff the bowl,
Death's billows near you roll,
    Come ere you're lost.
Burst from the tyrant's reign
Break now the tempter's chain,
Be freemen once again.
    Join with our host.
