I herd her meek and patient sighs,
I saw the furtive glances steal
From her blue, timid, drooping eye,
And felt the soft appeal.
I thought, when absent, of her charms;
By every soft endeavour,
I flew to win her to my arms,
But -- she was gone forever.

I saw her heart that still confessed
In throbs beneath her modest zone
And snowy undulating vest,
Where Love had fixed his throne.
I hastened from that gentle heart
Each lurking pain to sever,
