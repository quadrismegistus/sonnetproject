What can I write in the, O dainty book?
    About whose daintiness faint perfume lingers,
Into whose pages dainty ladies look,
    And turn thy dainty leaves with daintier fingers?

Fitter my ruder muse for ruder sung;
    My scrawling quill to coarser paper matches;
My voice, in laughter raised too loud and long,
    Is hoarse and cracked with shouting tavern catches

No melodies have I for ladies' ear,
    No roundelays for jocund lads or lasses;
But only brawlings born of bitter beer,
    And chorused with the clink and clash of glasses.

Go tell thy mistress pretty friend for me
    I cannot do her 'hest for all her frowning;
