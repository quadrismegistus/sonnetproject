A sung for the death-day of the brave -- 
    A sung of pride!
The youth went down to a hero's grave,
    With the Sword, his bride.
 [Footnote: 1Kb]

He went, with his noble heart unworn,
    And pure, and high;
An eagle stooping from clouds of morn,
    Only to die.

He went with the lyre, whose lofty tone
    Beneath his hand
Had thrilled to the name of his God alone,
    And his fatherland.

And with all his glorious feelings yet
