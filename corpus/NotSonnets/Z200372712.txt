I have stood on the brink of the grave:
    Savage feet have imprinted the sand;
But and arm that was mighty to save,
    Has saved in this terrible land.
How awful the silence appeared
    Of this once uninhabited plain!
When the shrieks of the dying were herd,
    How I wished for that silence again!

But the tempest which gathered around
    Was fraught with a blessing for me;
One victim a refuge has found,
    I, Friday, a treasure in thee.
Some affection the bosom requires,
    It seeks to be cherished again;
