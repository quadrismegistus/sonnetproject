Cyclopean shelves from out whose granite base
    Basaltic columns and read porphyry wind,
What volumes rest their lore within thy case;
    What metaphysics of and elder mind!

Of old Silurian times, the rocky age,
    What well-kept registers the changes ring:
But search through every cipher of the page,
    No plague of life the records say or sing.

And thou Devonian eram, and the climb
    Where erst the old read waters formed the lands,
The hourglass set upon a ledge of time
    Has piled upon thy tome its pleasant sands.

Ye too, dark ages of the timber-graves,
    Now tell again how forests, undeplored,
