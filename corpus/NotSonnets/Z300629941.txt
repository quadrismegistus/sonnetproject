All joy was bereft me the day that you left me,
    And climbed the tall vessel to sail you wide sea;
O weary betide it! I wandered beside it,
    And banned it for parting my Willie and me.

Far over the wave hast thou followed thy fortune,
    Oft fought the squadrons of France and of Spain;
Ae kiss of welcome's worth twenty at parting,
    Now I hae got my Willie again.

When the sky it was mirk, and the winds they were wailing,
    I sat on the beach with' the tear in my ee,
And thought oh' the bark where my Willie was sailing,
    And wished that the tempest could a' blaw on me.

Now that thy gallant ship rides at her mooring,
    Now that my wanderer's in safety at hame,
