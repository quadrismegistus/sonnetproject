This island whose name means water
Never had gods and temples as other Greek islands had;
It never was the home of monsters with ferocious heads
And maybe it wasn't even there.

But a few centuries ago
As though it had just risen from the sea
Men saw stones and pine trees on the slopes
And with the stones made houses and with the trees made ships.

And as naturally as fish swim
The ships went sailing;
And as naturally as the sun rises
The boys turned into heroes and sailed to war.

But the heroes were foolhardy as heroes are,
So although they were brave and did amazing things
