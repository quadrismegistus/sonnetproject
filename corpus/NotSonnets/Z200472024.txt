To-day the mother's heart her son embraces,
    To-day the father hears -- though' eyes are dim -- 
    His boy beside him sing the Easter Hymn;
With glorious wounds now healed and with no traces
Of pain upon their proud triumphant faces,
    Alert, and as the angels strong of limb,
    Our lads troop homeward in their battle trim
And haunt once more the old familiar places.

For many bodies from the graves arise
    Appearing unto many, and we feel
        The church is filled with more than we can see;
        We -- they -- one army sworn for Christ to free
    All Europe from the hate of blood and steel
And bring back love by life's pure sacrifice.
