In vain fair sorceress, thy eyes speak charms,
In vain thou makest lose circles with thy arms.
I'm 'above thy spells. No magic him can move,
In whom Castara hath inspired her love.
As she, keep thou strict cent'nell over thy ear,
Lest it the whispers of soft Courtiers hear;
Read not his raptures, whose invention must
Write journey work, both for his Patrons lust,
And his own plush: let no admirer feast
His eye oath' naked banquet of thy breast.
If this fair president, nor yet my want
Of love, to answer thine, make thee recant
Thy sorceries; Pity shall to justice turn,
And judge thee, witch, in thy own flames to burn.
