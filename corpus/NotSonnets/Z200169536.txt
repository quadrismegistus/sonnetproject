He starts, he strikes -- whose lifeblood wets his blade?
Alas, 'this that of the Byzantine maid! -- 

Despair, false satrap! -- what avail thee now
Platea's laurels wreathed about thy brow? -- 
They may perchance avert the lightning's force,
But not the fiery arrows of remorse.
To guard thy haunted solitude from pain,
Those Median and Egyptian slaves are vain;
Thine oriental feasts and Persian state,
The pomps Barbaric which around thee wait,
Appease not, cannot unto sleep persuade
Unhappy Cleonice's angry shade.
Seek if thou wilt the blooming royal bride,
To thine ambitious fancy long allied;
