Trembling hands clasp ruddy fingers,
    Beauty bought and sold!
Rich Age beckons, -- beauty lingers, -- 
    Oh, the might of Gold!
By my soul! a sorry sighed,
Sad Age linked to beauty bright.

Youth for wealth -- unholy dealing!
    Is thy blood so cold?
Deaf to Nature's mute appealing, -- 
    Oh, the might of Gold!
Woe is me, a sorry sighed,
Sad Age linked to beauty bright.

Thou hast dreamed of warm caresses,
    His will be so cold;
