Jesus, sinner's Friend, receive us,
    Feeble, famishing, and faint;
O Thou Bread of Life, relieve us
    Now, or now we die for want:
Lest we faint, and die for ever,
    Thou our sinking spirits stay;
Give some token of Thy favour,
    Empty send us not away.

We have in the desert tarried
    Long, and nothing have to eat;
Comfort us, through wandering wearied,
    Feed our souls with living meat;
Still with bowels of compassion
    See, Thy helpless people see;
