Oh! thou false wave, that seemdest so wondrous smooth,
When a loved brother pressed thy yielding bosom,
"What shall be said of thee?" Shall I arraign
Thee, simple instrument, that proudly boar
A darling boy from his found mother's arms?
Ah, no! far, far remote th'all-powerful cause
Of thy officious zeal. -- Yet in thy depths
Lives there a Nereid, or a Sea-god, stern,
Who boar the mandate down thy fatal stream,
Or, with their tridents, pushed the wandering youth
To his last port? O God, what tremors shook
The strongest powers of my reluctant soul,
When, from his eyes, I took their farewell gaze;
So pensive, yea, so full of promised death,
