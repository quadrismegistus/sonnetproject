Since Spirit first inspired, pervaded all,
And Mind met Matter, at that' Eternal call -- 
Since dust weighed Genius down, or Genius gave
Th' immortal halo to the mortal's grave;
Th' ambitious soul her essence hath defined,
And Mind hath eulogized the powers of Mind.
Ere Revelation's holy light began
To strengthen Nature, and illumine Man -- 
When Genius, on Icarian pinions, flew,
And Nature's pencil, Nature's portrait, drew;
When Reason shuddered at her own won beam,
And Hope turned pale beneath the sickly gleam -- 
Ev'n then hath Mind's triumphant influence spoke,
Dust owned the spell, and Plato's spirit woke --
