As when, with empty purse, and tattered weed,
By superstition urged to pious deed,
An youthful pilgrim seeks some sacred fane,
Thro' many a lonely wood and pathless plain,
When sullen winter vents its stormy rage,
Beneath the feeble sun's contracted stage;
Till, glimmering in his just-departing light,
The gilded turrets catch the ravished sighed.
But soon the treacherous pilot disappears,
While hideous howls affright his trembling ears;
Then, swiftly back, with terror winged, he flies,
And soon his peaceful cell salutes his eyes;
There, stills his breast, within the safe abided,
Resolved, no more, to try the dangerous road.
