VVhy do so many fondly dote upon
Parnassus Tempe, and that Helicon
Renowned by the Greeks? why praise they so
The Muses haunting Tiber, Thames, and Po;
As if no other Hill, or Grove, or Spring,
Should yield such Raptures, as these forth did bring?
Behold, even from these uncouth shores, among
Unpeopled woods, and hills, these strains were sung:
And most of theirs they seem to parallel,
Who boast to drink of Aganippe's well.
Despair not therefore, you that love the Muses,
If any Tyrant, you, or yours abuses:
For these will follow you, and make you mirth,
Eu'n at the furthest Angles of the Earth,
