From the source comes the imagery and language,
compassion and complexity in the one
achieved in the imagination conjured,
admired in surrender and transcendence:
where is the perfect man?

Words beyond words to conjure this malaise
to infamy and death in effort
immanence forsaken:
to blow the music
maelstrom-tempered.

Our mode is our jam session
of tradition,
passed in this present moment
articulated, blown through
