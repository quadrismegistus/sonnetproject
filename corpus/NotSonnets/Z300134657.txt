'What did you see when they unrolled the bandage?'
'Everything was very gray and crumbly.
I did lift and arm, it was Like a dead thing,
dropped right back; I thought that was terrible.
And the stench, to know it was your own, Jesus!'
'Speaking of whom, did he come back to see you?'
'Not he. He's Like all shamans, do the job and
get the glory. He's off preaching somewhere.
Here am I with eyes Like pits, limbs twitching,
clothes falling off me, sisters wailing, children
running from me in the street I'm so gruesome -- 
children I love, running away, you call this
living? What does he know about living?'
'Do you agree with those who wish to kill him?'
