O sweet and pure and tender heart,
With the child's gift to prey and play,
Thou, artless in thy perfect art,
Could'st blissful tears to us impart,
And smile the blissful tears away.

Most human thou of humankind,
What wealth of love accrued to thee!
To thee dumb creatures looked to find
The meanings which their wistful mind
Was groping for, and could not see.

We were the better for the mirth,
We were the better for the tears,
We were the better seeing worth,
In the dumb creatures of the earth,
