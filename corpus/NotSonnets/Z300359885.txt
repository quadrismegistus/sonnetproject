When I closed my eyes I could see
the head of a girl in half-light.
But was it you? She had your
aristocratic arch of the neck
and your pretty curls, but where
were your laugh and your sparkle?
And your glance towards me wasn't
particularly affectionate.

I ran through the catalog of
passed loves but this girl was
not there. She must have been you.
But the frown? How had I
displeased you? Please tell me,
but then visions can't talk.
