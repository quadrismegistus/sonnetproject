Oh! heed not those beams, though awhile they illumine,
    And shed over thy soul the repose of the blessed;
They gleam but to leave thee mid night's darkness glooming,
    And only deceive thee and mock thy unrest.

Too long have I gazed over false visions, foretelling
    Of joy and of happiness never to be mine;
Too long -- o! too long -- has this lone breast been dwelling
    O'er bright dreams, alas! which destroy as they shine!

Our idols, what are they? -- that thus they should linger
    And cling round our hearts mid disease and decay:
All earthly -- they die -- touched by Time's leaden finger,
    And leave us to weep over the close of life's day.

And yet how we love them, and wreathe them with beauty,
    While the sunlight of day is in its first prime;
