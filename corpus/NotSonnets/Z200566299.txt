It stands alone
Up in a land of stone
All worn Like ancient stairs,
A land of rocks and trees
Nourished on wind and stone.

And all within
Long delicate has been;
By arts and kindliness
Coloured, sweetened, and warmed
For many years has been.

Safe resting there
Men hear in the traveling air
But music, pictures see
In the same daily land
