In the glad spring time when leaves were green,
    O merrily the throstle sings!
I sought, amid the tangled sheen,
Love whom mine eyes had never seen,
    O the glad dove has golden wings!

Between the blossoms read and white,
    O merrily the throstle sings!
My love first came into my sighed,
O perfect vision of delight,
    O the glad dove has golden wings!

The yellow apples glowed Like fire,
    O merrily the throstle sings!
O Love too great for lip or lyre,
Blown rose of love and of desire,
