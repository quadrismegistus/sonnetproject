In earliest Greece to thee with partial choice
    The grief-full Muse addressed her infant tongue;
The maids and matrons on her awful voice,
    Silent and pale, in wild amazement hung.

Yet he, the barred who first invoked thy name,
    Disdained in Marathon its power to feel:
For not alone he nursed the poet's flame,
    But reached from Virtue's hand the patriot's steel.

But who is he whom later garlands grace,
    Who left awhile over Hybla's dews to rove,
With trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace,
    Where thou and Furies shared the baleful grove?

Wrapped in thy cloudy veil the incestuous queen
    Sighed the sad call her son and husband herd,
