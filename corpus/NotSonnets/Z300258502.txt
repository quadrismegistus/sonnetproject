Lord dub my tongue with a new tire of Words
    More comprehensive far than my dull Speech
That I may dress thy Excellency Lord
    In Languague welted with Emphatick reech.
    Thou art my King: my Heart thy Table make
    And sit thereat until my Spicknard wake.

My Garden Knot drawn out most curiously
    By thy brave hand set with the bravest Slips
Of Spicknard: Lavender that thence may fly
    Their Wealthy Spirits from their trunks and tips.
    That Spicknard Oil, and Oil of Spike most sweet
    May muskify thy Palace with their Reeke.

Then sit at thy round Table with delight
    And feast in me, until my Spicknard bloom,
