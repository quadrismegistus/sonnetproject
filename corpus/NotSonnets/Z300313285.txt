Now eves hours hight noons succeed
& days herralds winged speed
Flusht with summer's ruddy face
Hies to light some cooler place
Now her hand wip 'dustrys dropped
And the din of labours stopped
Horses gingling in their gears
Waggons ringing in ones ears
Lumping frail & smacking whip
Boys loud bawls of 'rose' & 'hip'
All are silent free from care
Welcome boon of night to share
Pleasd I wander from the town
Pestered by the selfish clown
