The day was done, the evening dawned
    Bright, calm and beautiful!
But ere the rising morrow's sun,
Full many a life its raze had run;
The earthquake's shock its work had done -- 
    Destruction terrible!

The people filled with fear and awe,
    Before Jehovah bow.
Low in the dust the Sovereign saw
Ten thousand who had scorned his law,
Pleading deliverance from Death's jaw -- 
    They cry for mercy now.

Another shock! the people wail
    And rush forth helplessly.
