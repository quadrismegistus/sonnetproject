Like wonder do those folk beget,
Whose Arms and hands in Thighes are set,
They thrash their backs, as 'it with flail.
With that they wear behind a Taile.
Their wives too out of all mistaking,
For all the world are of that making.
Unlesse they bear, they think't a crime,
Foure babes at once (well in good time)
Two of their Barnes the self same day,
They do preserve, and two they slay.
For milk, their breasts so much do bear,
It makes them Cheeses all the year.
Sure for these Monsters fist it grows
In thigh, that it may reach their Toes,
