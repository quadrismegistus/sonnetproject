Treading the path to nobler ends,
A long farewell to love I gave,
Resolved my country, and my friends,
All that remained of me should have.

And this resolve no mortal dame,
None but those eyes could have overthrown,
The nymph I dare not, needs not name,
So high, so Like herself alone.

Thus the tall oak, which now aspires
Above the fear of private fires,
Grown and designed for nobler use,
Not to make warm, but built the house,
Though from our meaner flames secure,
Must that which falls from heaven endure.
