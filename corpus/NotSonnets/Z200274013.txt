Star of Napoleon! wont to shed
False glory round thy master's head;
Thou radiant, but abhorred deceit,
Which millions rushed in arms to greet;
Wild meteor of infernal birth!
Rising from hell to set on earth!

Souls of the murdered formed thy rays;
And Nature shuddered at thy blaze;
The discord of thy frenzied sphere
In groans vibrated on the ear;
And thy light shone on human eyes,
Like a volcano of the skies.

Like lava rolled thy stream of blood!
And swept down empires in its flood.
