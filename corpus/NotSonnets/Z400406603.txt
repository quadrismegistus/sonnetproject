This little Blade (by that' other men vain glory
It seems was roughly used, (so says the Story)
But being strongly heated, and high flown,
In rage he flies on Story, pulls him down:
But when they ris, I know not how it fated,
One God the worst, the Story was translated
From white to read, but ever the fight was ended,
It seems one, whom the little man befriended,
Came in and parted them; the little Blade
There's no man could entreat, nor yet persuade,
But he would fight still, till another came,
And with persuasions counseled 'gainst the same,
'Twas in this manner, Friend, you shall not fight
With one that's so unequal to your height.
