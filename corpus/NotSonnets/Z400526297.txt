Free from that partial, blind respect,
Which marks the favourite of a sect,
    Implicitly resigned,
With others' eyes she scorned to see,
And stretched her arms of charity,
    Engrasping all mankind.

In love and every grace she grew,
As nearer her departure drew;
    The active, restless soul
From strength to greater strength went on,
Swifter and swifter still she run,
    To reach the heavenly goal.

She lived a burning shining light,
With never-fading lustre bright,
