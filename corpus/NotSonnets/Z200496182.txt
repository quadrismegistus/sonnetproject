Along the mead Europa walks
    To choose the fairest of its gems,
Which plucking from their slender stalks,
    She weaves in fragrant diadems.

Where ere the beauteous virgin treads,
    The common people of the field,
To kiss her feet bowing their heads,
    Homage as to their Goddess yield.

Twixt whom ambitious wars arise,
    which to the Qeen shall first present
A gift Arabian spice outvies,
    The votive offering of their scent.

When deathless Amaranth this strife,
    Greedy by dying to decide,
