Illustrious Prince! by Heav'n designed
To guard the Rights of Humankind,
    And raise a falling State:
To scourge the Proud, support the Brave,
To check Oppressive Pow'r, and save
    An Empire from it's Fate:

What Poet, with MÃ¦onian Wing,
Shall your Immortal Praises sing,
    And glorious Acts record?
Tell, how young William bravely bled;
How Bourbon's Legions trembling fled
    Before your Conq'ring Sword?

The Muse admires the noble Theme;
The Muse would gladly found your Fame;
