Time, with thy kind and never-wearying powers,
Giving whatever we fondly count as ours;
Life, love, hope, faith, the sun, the stars and flowers;
    All that to man is dear to thee we owe!
Yet does he call thee, slayer, robber, thief,
And stern, as of his foes thou were the chief,
Filling his path with ruins, pain and grief,
    Without one tender blessing to bestow!

Nature we laud, when thou, paternal Time,
Hast given maturity, as well as prime,
To all her works, in every age and climb,
    Since the first floweret on her bosom grew.
Light from the darkness does thy hand unfold
Beauty from dust we in thy deeds behold:
