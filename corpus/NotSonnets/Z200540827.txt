Lord, thou art always our abided!
Before the world, beginning had
Thou were't eternally our God;
Yea, long, ever heaven & earth were made.
Thou sayest, ye sons of men, return;
And, straight returned to dust they be:
As one nights watch, or day outworn,
    So, are a thousand years to thee.

Thou, Like a Flood (as in a dream)
Shalt sweep them suddenly away;
For, Like the flowering grass they seem,
That springs, & fades, in a day.
One frown of thine, cousumes us quite;
Thy wrath, our troubles does renew;
