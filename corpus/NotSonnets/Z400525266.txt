Father, Thy feeble children meet,
    And make Thy faithful mercies known;
Give us through faith the flesh to eat,
    And drink the blood of Christ Thy Son;
Honour Thine own mysterious ways,
    Thy sacramental presence show,
And all the fullness of Thy grace,
    With Jesus, on our souls bestow.

Father, our sacrifice receive;
    Our souls and bodies we present,
Our goods, and vows, and praises give,
    Whate'er Thy bounteous love hath lent.
Thou canst not now our gift despise,
    Cast on that all-atoning Lamb,
