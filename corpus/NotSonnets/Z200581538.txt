The sea is and acre of dull glass, the land is a table
My eyes jump down from the table and go running down as far
    as they are able
While one is still young and still able to employ
Nerves muscles sinews eyes mouth teeth head
A giant that threw a stone at Caerodunum
Transforming England into a salty pancake
Lichen-alive governed in gametosporous colonies
Crescented with calciform corollae, a great stone marsh
With the dragons of dead Hercules debating
There is no end there is no end to the labours of Hercules
While one is still young and still able to employ
Feet fist eyes in the head a spade a spanner
Down down we go down the emblematic abyss
