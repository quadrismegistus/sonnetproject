I know my trust, on whom I have believed, [Side note: 1Kb]
    So certain that I cannot be deceived:
        God is my rock, and all in vain,
    You Like a bird to that' hills would have me fly,
        For he, who can this rock but gain,
        His En'mies arrows may defy,
The bird, whose feathers wing them, never soared so high.

    I saw the wicked draw the fatal bow,
    And from the string I saw the arrow go;
        It leveled was at the upright,
    And had assuredly sunk into his heart;
        His Innocence had been the White,
        Had not that' Almighty took his part,
And on his head, who shot it, turned the vengeful dart.
