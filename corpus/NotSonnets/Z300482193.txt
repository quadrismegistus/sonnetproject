If, gentle Lady, thou hast paid
    Thy faithful vows at Hymen's shrine,
Oft in these silken folds be laid
    Each tender animated line,

Which absent Love sincerely pours
    As business urges forced delay;
Kind sunbeams of the wintered hours,
    When thy dear Lord is far away.

And, gentle Lady, round thy knees
    Do blooming infants gaily sport,
With duteous smiles essay to please,
    With lifted eyes thy favour court?

O! may their virtues noontide rays,
    That now, in Life's fresh morning dawn,
