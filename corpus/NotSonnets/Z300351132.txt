Here stands a Regal Coloss; whose high Head,
Is by the fixed Stars, embellished.
By sumptuous Pageants, the Streets are become
Accurate Emblems, of Elysium.
Cursed Nero's Court, foiled the most serene days;
By the emission of her golden Rayes.
And with Reluctance, we did lately see;
The Tyrants Palace, Romes Epitome.
That which was then and incommodious Lake,
Is made a Theater; for the Champions sake.
Where tepid Baths, the sinews recreate;
Was once a Victim, to the Monsters Hate.
Claudius Porch, so celebrious for shade,
Of the last Part, of the Domo was made.
