Push the bottle about, name the toast, and away,
    With wine be our sentiments flowing;
We idly grow old while we drinking delay,
    Be merry, my bucks, and keep doing.
Keep doing I say, fill it up to the brink,
'Tis a trouble to talk, 'this a trouble to think,
'Tis a trouble -- no, no! -- this a pleasure to drink.
        Prithee ring, we must have to'ther bottle.

Our classic is Bacchus, his volumes prefer,
    To all that's in old Aristotle;
But why, with quotations, should we make a stir?
    We'll stir about briskly the bottle.
A fool once to find how the world could go round,
Leap'd into the deep where the puppy was drowned,
