Inuention many thousand ways could go,
To show their variations to and from:
For as upon the soul of man attends,
The world, the flesh, the devil, (three wicked fri&ebar;ds)
So likewise hath a Begger other three,
With whom his humour never could agree.
[Footnote: 1Kb]A Justice to the world he does compare,
And for his flesh, a Beadle is a snare:
But he, that he of all accounts most evil,
He thinks a Constable to be the Devil.
And 'this as easy for him as to drink,
To blind the world, and make a [Footnote: 1Kb] Justice wink;
The Beadle (for the flesh) 'this little pain,
Which smart he can recover soon again.
