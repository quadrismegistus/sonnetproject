Not in a mean degree,
    Am I obliged, LORD,
For thy enlightening grace to me,
    Vouchsafed by thy Word:
    Nor less obliged am I,
    To sing thy daily praise,
That, I have guides to rectify
    My knowledge, and my ways.

    For, through each Age, o God,
    Thy Priests thou hast ordained,
To spread that saving-Truth abroad,
    Whereby our bliss is gained.
    Yea, they thy Shepherds be,
    Thy Flocks to feed and keep;
