Where the sacked Hamlet darts expiring gleams,
Through smouldering clouds; and thy encrimsoned streams,
Wabash! slow rolling to the western bourn,
Thy slaughtered sons in sullen murmurs mourn;
There, if ever chance the traveller shall led,
The blood drenched shore with reverence let him tread,
And mark the spot where oft at eve unseen
The weeping Genii plant the laurel green,
And Fancy bids her choicest flowrets rise
To deck the lonely grave where Wyllys lies.

If polished manners, undisguised by art,
The tenderest feelings, and the firmest heart,
Where lavish heaven united every grace
To the mild virtues of the Wyllys raze:
