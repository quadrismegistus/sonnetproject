Theirs is a perfection of pure from.
Nobody but has his proper place and knows it.
Everything they do is functional.
Each foray in a zigzag line
Each prodigious lifting
Of thirty-two times their own weight
Each excavation into the earth's core
Each erection
Of a crumbly parapetted tower -- 

None of these feats is a private pleasure,
None of them done
For the sake of the skill alone -- 

They've God a going concern down there,
A full egg-hatchery
