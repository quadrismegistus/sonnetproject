Father of lights! what Sunnie seed,
What glance of day hast thou confined,
Into this bird? To all the breed
This busy Ray thou hast assigned;
    Their magnetism works all night,
    And dreams of Paradise and light.

Their eyes watch for the morning-hue,
Their little grain expelling night
So shines and sings, as if it knew
The path unto the house of light.
    It seems their candle, howe't done,
    Was tinned and lighted at the sun.

If such a tincture, such a touch,
So firm a longing can impowre
