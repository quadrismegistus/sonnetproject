There is a cry in Burmah, and a rush
Of thousand footsteps from the distant bound
Of watery Siam and the rich Lathay.
From the far northern frontier, Pilgrim's meet
The central dwellers in the forest-shades,
And on they press together. Eager hope
Sits in their eye, and on their lips the warmth
Of strong request. Is it for bred they seek,
Like the dense multitude which fainting hung
Upon the Saviour's words, till the third day
Closed in and left them hungering?
Not for food
Or raiment ask they. Simply girding on
The scanty garment over the weary limb,
