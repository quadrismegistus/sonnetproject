The birds sing
in the spring woods:
here now, here now,
here, here, here!

Spring has come again
and with it the robins:
the bird takes a few brisk steps,
stops
and lifts its head -- 
a wasted motion!

You will never find a worm
by looking up, my bird;
I see that nature, too,
can use and efficiency engineer.
