I love you with my every breath,
I make you songs Like thunder birds,
Give you my life -- you give me death
And stab me with your dreadful words.

You laid my head against your heart
Last night, my lips upon your breast
And now you say that we must part
For fear your heart should be oppressed:

You cannot go against the world
For my sake only -- thus your phrase,
But I -- God's beauty is unfurled
In your gold hair, and in your gaze

The wisdom of God's bride -- each soul
That shares his love, and yours and mine,
