Ye Patriots of the World, whose Cares combined,
Consult the public Welfare of Mankind,
One Moment let the crowding Kingdoms wait,
And Europe in suspense attend her Fate,
Which turns on Your great Councils; nor refuse
To hear the Strains of the Prophetick Muse;
Who sees those Councils with a generous Care
Heal the wide Wounds, and calm the Rage of War;
She sees new Verdure all the Plain overspread,
Where the Fight burned, and where the Battle bled.
The Fields of Death a softer Scene disclose,
And Ceres smiles, where Iron Harvests rose.
The bleating Flocks along the Bastion pass,
And from the awful Ruins crop the Grass.
