Fionn, who in those days was chief of the Fianna,
    Started to seek in the mountains his prey;
With him his wolf-hounds, Brann, Brod and Lomluath,
    Making over mead and through woodland their way,
Down to the glen of the thunderstruck oak-tree,
    Cleft in the rocks that were grassless and gray.

Presently Brann stopped and scented, then bounded
    Eagerly forward, the rest after him -- 
Ah! they were fleet and of noble endurance,
    Massive of jaw and of muscular limb;
Woe to the elk or the wolf they encountered -- 
    Triumph for them, but destruction to him!

Fionn followed fast, in the chase ever earnest,
    Came where the hounds stood in front of their prey;
