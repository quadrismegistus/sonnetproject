O you who sail on India's wealthy wave,
    Of gems and gold who spoil the radiant East;
What ocean's, say, what isles of fragrance gave
    This fairer treasure to the joyful West?
What banks of Ganges, and what balmy skies
Saw the first infant dawn of those unclouded eyes?

By easy Arts while Europe's beauty's reign,
    Roll the blue languish of their humid eye;
Rule willing slaves, who court and kiss the chain,
    Self-vanquish'd, helpless to resist or fly;
Less yielding souls confess this Eastern Fair,
And lightning melts the heart that milder sire's would spare.

Of Gods, enamoured with a mortal dame,
    Let Grecian story tell -- the gifts display
