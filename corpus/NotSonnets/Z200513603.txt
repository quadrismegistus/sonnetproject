Recollect, as well you may,
    (You that pine and brood in sorrow)
If there's little luck today,
    More is left to come tomorrow;
Every present grows to passed
    Almost while the grumbler heeds it;
But, for pleasure made to last,
    Look to where the future feeds it.

Coming chances must be more,
    (Reason will herself remind us,)
And all prizes crowd before
    If the blanks are all behind us;
Therefore never go downcast,
    But let cares sit all the lighter,
