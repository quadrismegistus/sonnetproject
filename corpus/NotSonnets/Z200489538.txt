Make Haste, my Heart, fly to that peerless Dame,
For whom I burn in and unusual Flame;
    Tell Her what numerous Racks I bear,
    What Wounds from Grief, what Wounds from Care;
But ah! my Heart, that thou to Her must run
To seek Relief, by whom thou art undone.

Say how with Show'rs of Tears my Eyes still flow,
Which nourish Grief, and but augment my Woe.
    How Time, and Life for Her I waste,
    My Time, and Life that fly too fast;
Tell Her, these Wrongs I patiently endure,
Only in Hope's from Her to find a Cure.

But though' in Tears I'm drowned, in Flames I burn,
And though' amid a Thousand Cares I mourn,
