Lovers may find similitudes
to the sweet babbling girlish noise,
in the unhuman crystal voice
that calls from mountain solitudes;

as that's but movement overlaid
with water, a faint shining thought,
spirit is to music wrought
in the swift passion of a maid.

It is her body sings so clear,
chanting in the woods of night;
on Earth's dark precipice a white
Prometheus, bound Like water here;

the eager Joys towards their task
from dusky veins beat up in flocks,
