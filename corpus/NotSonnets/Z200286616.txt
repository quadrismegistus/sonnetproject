Among the happy wits this age hath shown,
Great, dear, sweet Bartas thou art matchless known;
My ravished Eyes and heart with faltering tongue,
In humble wise have vowed their service long,
But knowing task so great, & strength but small,
Gave over the work before begun withal,
My dazzled sighed of late reviewed thy lines,
Where Art, and more then Art, in nature shines,
Reflection from their beaming Altitude,
Did thaw my frozen hearts ingratitude;
Which Rayes darting upon some richer ground,
Had caused flours and fruits soon to abound;
But barren I my Dasey here do bring,
A homely flour in this my latter Spring,
