Like that soft lustre on the [deep?]
    When day and night have met
Or flowers which winds have bent and keep
    Their beauty yet,

Like showers that fall from sunlit clouds
    Upon a sunlit earth,
Like that bright bow which takes from light,
    And gloom its birth,

The glance which trembles in thine eye
    Appears to borrow,
Its hue from both extremes and shifts
    From joy to sorrow

It cannot be that thou hast known
    Night posts [?] in tears, not sleep --
