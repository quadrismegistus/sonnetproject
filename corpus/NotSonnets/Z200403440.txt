The fairest morn will have its cloud,
    Each pleasure hath its pain;
To strive against Almighty God,
    I trow it were but vain.

The Lily by the running Brook,
    At morn may glad the eye;
The Rose alike may waft its sweets,
    And in the evening die.

There's nought on earth that can escape,
    Or shun the will of God;
We all must yield unto our fate,
    And kiss the galling Rod.

Then why complain, since great and small,
    Alike must yield to fate;
