A Peacock was spreading his plumes on a wall,
    And hoped admiration to gain;
A Swallow determined to make him look small,
    And cure him of being so vain.

Said he, "My Lord Argus, how long may it be
    Since you from your travels returned?
'Tis really improving fine countries to see,
    This leisure no doubt you have earned."

"Let Swallows and Cuckoos take flight over sea,"
    The mortified Peacock replied;
"They've reason enough from the country to flee,
    Their heads at a distance to hide.

"Retirement at home suits my dignity best,
    My park and my palace are here."
