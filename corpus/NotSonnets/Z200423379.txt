True thoughts, your days of grief are done,
No more shall scorn or hate impede you; -- 
Born in the light, wherever the sun
Shines on mankind, mankind shall heed you.
    So grow, you grains of Mustardseed,
    Grow each into a tree;
    And kindle, sparks, to beal-fires bright,
    That all the earth may see;
    And spread, you thoughts of Truth and Right,
    O'er all humanity!

Time was, when thoughts boar tears and death
To the wise few that dared to raise them;
Time is, when thoughts are living breath,
And the world's throbbing heart obeys them.
