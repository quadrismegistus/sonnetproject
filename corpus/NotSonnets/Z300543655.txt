"Why, William, on that old gray stone,
Thus for the length of half a day,
Why, William, sit you thus alone,
And dream your time away?

To Beings else forlorn and blind!
Up! up! and drink the spirit breathed
From dead men to their kind.

As if she for no purpose boar you;
As if you were her firstborn birth,
And none had lived before you!"

One morning thus, by Esthwaite lake,
When life was sweet, I knew not why,
