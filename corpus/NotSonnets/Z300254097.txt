The Northern Crown, nearby Arcturus
in the meadows of the Bear,
for this abstract of stars
in the cold latitudes
affirming what is not
I gave my life -- see how she shines
in the clamorous night
around my famous head
as staggering I walk
sightless with tears away
from me and my little boy.
I never made this crazy contract
willingly, God.
