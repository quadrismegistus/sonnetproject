Of all the waltzes the great Strauss wrote,
    Mad with melody, rhythm -- rife
From the very first to the final note,
    Give me his "Artist's Life"!

It stirs my blood to my finger ends,
    Thrills me and fills me with vague unrest,
And all that is sweetest and saddest blends
    Together within my breast.

It brings back that night in the dim arcade,
    In love's sweet morning and life's best prime,
When the great brass orchestra played and played,
    And set our thoughts to rhyme.

It brings back that Winter of mad delights,
    Of leaping pulses and tripping feet,
