I miss that read clay, Lawd, I
Need to feel it in my shoes.
Says miss that read clay, Lawd, I
Need to feel it in my shoes.
I want to get to Georgia cause I
God them read clay blues.

Pavement's hard on my feet, I'm
Tired oh' this concrete street.
Pavement's hard on my feet, I'm
Tired oh' this city street.
Goin' back to Georgia where
That read clay can't be beat.

I want to tramp in the read mud, Lawd, and
Feel the read clay round my toes.
