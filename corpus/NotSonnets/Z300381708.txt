The setting orb of night her level ray
Shed over the land, and, on the dewy sward,
The lengthened shadows of the triple cross
Were laid far stretched, -- when in the east arose,
Last of the stars, day's harbinger: No found
Was herd, save of the watching soldier's foot:
Within the rock-barred sepulchre, the gloom
Of deepest midnight brooded over the dead,
The holy one; but, lo! a radiance faint
Began to dawn around his sacred brow:
The linen vesture seemed a snowy weath,
Drifted by storms into a mountain cave:
Bright, and more bright, the circling halo beamed
Upon that face, clothed in a smile benign,
