Lone occupiers of a naked sky
When desolate november hovers nigh
& all your fellow tribes in many crowds
Have left the village with the autumn clouds
Carless of old affections for the scene
That made them happy when the fields were green
& left them undisturbed to built their nests
In each old chimney Like to welcome guests
Forsaking all Like untamed winds they rome
& make with summer's and unsettled home
Following her favours to the farthest lands
Oer untraced ocean's & untrodden sands
Like happy images they haste away
& leave us lonely till another may
