Hath not the vision now
Its sure interpretation? Are there not
    Roots, bearing trunk nor bough,
Yet living in the earth, unseen, forgotten?

    Is there not, known to Thee,
Saviour and Lord, the church's living Head!
    Full many a goodly tree
Whose early shoots by Thee were nurtured, fed?

    But when thou hadst a right
To look for fruit, on these no fruit was found:
    Their beauty thou didst blight;
With brass and iron thou their root hast bound.

    Such are existing yet,
Permitted in thy boundless love to live;
