'TO is said of every dog that's found,
Of mongrel, spaniel, cur, and hound,
That each sustains a doggish mind,
And hates the new, sublime, refined.
'TO is hence the wretches bay the moon,
In beauty throned at highest noon,
Hence every nobler bruit they bite,
And hunt the stranger-dog with spite;
And hence, the nose's dictates parrying,
They fly from meat to feed on carrion.
'TO is also said, the currish soul
The critic raze possesses whole;
As near they come, in thoughts and nature's,
As two legged can, to four legged creatures;
