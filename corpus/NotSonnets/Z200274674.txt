No liquid Oil proceeds from Pumice-stone,
Nor Alchimist produce and Oil from thence:
T'is hard indeed if thou were such a one,
As loved a Scholler only for his Pence.
    But since that' enclosing of Endymion,
    He found some Oil from Secondarie Stone.

counsel they say is no commandment,
That's false if counsel be but equity:
Whereto a man must be obedient,
If he aspire unto f√¶licitie.
    No wrong had seized old Endymion,
    If he had taken counsel of a Stone.

Things passed, and things to come be different,
For they are gone, and these are in expect.
