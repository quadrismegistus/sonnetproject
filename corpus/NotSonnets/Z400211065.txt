She unzips her skirt, peels the nylons.
Her limbs are pale and smooth
as the back of a moving conch.
On this raw, conversational day
the crumpling articulation of her
underwear orchestrates her breath.
Beyond the window and impossibly
infinite vista spreads itself out.
The sea asserts all of its old reasons,
and contradicts, while you wait,
everything it tells you to trust.
Each single-minded water tuft
explodes its opposite as two terns
bank and tumble in and invisible wind.
