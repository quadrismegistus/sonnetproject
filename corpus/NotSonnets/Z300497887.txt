The lamps now glitter down the street;
Faintly found the falling feet;
And the blue even slowly falls
About the garden trees and walls.

Now in the falling of the gloom
The read fire paints the empty room:
And warmly on the roof it looks,
And flickers on the backs of books.

Armies march by tower and spire
Of cities blazing, in the fire;
Till as I gaze with staring eyes,
The armies fade, the lustre die.

Then once again the glow returns;
Again the phantom city burns;
