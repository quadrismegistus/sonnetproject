Oft when sweet music undulated round,
    Like the full moon out of a perfumed sea
Thine image from the waves of blissful found
    Rose and thy sudden light illumined me.

And in the country, leaf and flower and air
    Would altar and the eternal shape emerge;
Because they spoke of thee the fields seemed fair,
    And Joy to wait at the horizon's verge.

The little cloud-gaps in the east that filled
    Gray afternoons with bits of tenderest blue
Were windows in a palace pearly-silled
    That thy voluptuous traits came glimmering through.

And in the city, dominant desire
    For which men toil within its prison-bars,
