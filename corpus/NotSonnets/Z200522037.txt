'Tis the "leafy month of June,"
And the faintly glimmering moon,
In the East her cresset rearing,
Shows that summer's eve is wearing;
But the Sun is lingering still
O'er the old accustomed hill;
Twilight's shadows hovering 'round him,
Like a king, when foes surround him,
Gathering, since he scorns to fly,
Life's last energies to die!
 [End note: 1Kb]
See, the parting God of day
Leaves a trail upon his way,
Like the memory of the dead
