[Side note: 1Kb]To chasten me, O gracious God,
    In Anger do not choose;
Nor ever Thy correcting Rod
    In hight Displeasure use.
[Side note: 1Kb]O spare me, Lord, in Pity spare,
    For weak and faint I lie,
O Lord, my Bones tormented are,
    Thy healing Art apply.

[Side note: 1Kb]My Soul too feels great Misery,
    Still Wailings shall I make?
[Side note: 1Kb]Return, O Lord, deliver me,
    For Thy great Mercy's sake.
[Side note: 1Kb]Is there among the silent Dead
    Remembrance of thy Name?
