As you are the worst Jonah I know I address this letter to you.

(Remember the time at Victoria
We boarded a train for Dulwich
And landed in the middle of Kent?
They said it was a signalman's mistake,
But was it?
And George arrived late in Leeds for a reading
And the porter had put him
On the wrong train.
At first I herd and believed
'Porter put me on the wrong train.'

Why does one always expect you to arrive
Half and hour late? However -- )
