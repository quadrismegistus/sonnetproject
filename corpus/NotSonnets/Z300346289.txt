Go, Mary, to the summer-house,
    And sweep the wooden floor,
And light the little fire, and wash
    The pretty varnished door;
For there the London gentleman,
    Who lately lectured here,
Will smoke a pipe with Jonathan,
    And taste our home-brewed beer.

Go, bind the dahlias, that our guest
    May praise their fading die;
But strip of every withered bloom
    The flower that wone the prize!
And take thy father's knife, and prune
    The roses that remain;
