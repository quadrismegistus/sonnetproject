The Judge his favour timely then extends,
    When a good Cause is destitute of friends,
Without the pomp of counsel; or more Aide,
    Then to make falsehood blush, and fraud afraid:
When those good few, that her Defenders be,
    Are there for Charity, and not for fee.
Such shall you hear to Day, and find great foes
    Both armed with wealth, and slander to oppose,
Who thus long safe, would gain upon the times
    A right by the prosperity of their Crimes;
Who, though their gilded, and perjury they know,
    Think, yea and boast, that they have done it so
As though the Court pursues them on the sent,
    They will come of, and escape the Punishment,
