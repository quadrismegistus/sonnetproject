It is not wise to love too well
A certain square of leaf and loam,
A certain hillside's tawny swell,
Arbitrarily called home.

The river that you cleave apart
Today with hasty, heedless stride
May fling a coil about your heart
That you can never toss aside.

The aspen leaves that lift so thin
A web against the waning day
May weave a net to bind you in
Time cannot wither or tear away.

The hill you climb so laughingly,
Plundering all its meager lore,
