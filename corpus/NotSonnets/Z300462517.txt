Swiftly flashed the fatal tidings
From the land of southern brightness,
From the land of palm and olive,
Land of cypress and of myrtle,
Telling to the Queenly Mourner
That, within the inmost circle
Of the dear ones, loved and loving,
Yet another place was vacant,
Yet another from departed; -- 
Telling to the wife and mother
That her child was left and orphan,
That her life had lost its brightness,
Lost what made it worth the living,
Left to tread the path which leads
