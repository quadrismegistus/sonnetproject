"Like some poor bark on the rough ocean tossed,
My rudder broken, and my compass lost,
My sails the coarsest, and too thin to last,
Pelted by rains, and bore to many a blast,
My anchor, Hope, scarce fixed enough to stay
Where the strong current Grief sweeps all away,
I sail along, unknowing how to steer.
Where quicksands lie and frowning rocks appear.
Life's ocean teems with foes to my frail bark,
The rapid swordfish, and the ravening shark,
Where torpid things crawl forth in splendid shell,
And knaves and fools and sycophants live well.
What have I left in such tempestuous sea?
No Tritons shield, no Naiads shelter me!
