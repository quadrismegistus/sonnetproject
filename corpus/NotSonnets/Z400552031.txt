The Highlanders are not a sensitive people
But exactly the opposite; I am all
For the de-Tibetanisation of the Hebrides.
It is perfect humbug to imagine
There is a reservation there for fine forms of consciousness,
Where the natives cultivate rare soul-states,
Handfed principles and choice spiritualities
Much as the Sassunach tenants of the deer forests, grouse-moors, and lochs,
Rear and tend the young stalk of their sports.

Yet, beloved, as who upon the Cornish moors
Breaks apart a piece of rock will find it
Impregnated through and through with the smell of honey
So lies the Gaelic tradition in the lives
Of our dourest, most unconscious, and denying Scots.
