Aye you're a man that! you old mesmerizer
Tyin' your meanin' in seventy swadelin's,
One must of needs be a hanged early riser
To catch you at worm turning. Holy Odd's bodykins!

"Cat's I' the water butt!" Thought's in your verse-barrel,
Tell us this thing rather, then we'll believe you,
You, Master Bob Browning, spite your apparel
Jump to your sense and give praise as weed lief do.

You wheeze as a head-cold long-tonsilled Calliope,
But God! what a sighed you would' God oh' our in'ards,
Mad as a hatter but surely no Myope,
Broad as all ocean and leanin' man-kin'ards.

Heart that was big as the bowels of Vesuvius,
Words that were winged as her sparks in eruption,
