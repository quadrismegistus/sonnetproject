He was my fondest friend -- and he is dead -- 
    Dead in the vigorous fullness of his prime,
    Lost to my seeing for all coming time;
Now, ere oblivion close above his head,
Let me look back across our mingled years,
And count how he was worth this heartache and these tears.

Purer devotion, steadier truth than his,
    Not even the most exacting heart could crave;
    Demanding little, all he had, he gave,
Nor wronged his love by doubts and jealousies,
But kept his constant faith unto the end,
Kind, loyal, trusting, brave, a true ideal friend.

Envy nor prejudice he never knew,
    Nor breathed a syllable of wrath or blame,
