Because I have no death to breathe backward into,
so little life to lie lovingly on,
less and less saviour to kneel and balance to,
none to bless, none to crucify, no, not one;

though I have left all gates and windows open
to rain and strangers in the fire-faced storms,
only the lost, the mad, the murdered enter
weak with weeping and crowned with indelible thorns.

How narrow the figures, moved on a checkered mile;
hooded bishops and kings with painted eyes
who mock at the mirror of rage, stand speechless while
the body betrays its old agonies.

Because the desperate mind demands witness,
and all the guilty seek conspirator,
