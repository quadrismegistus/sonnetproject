Christ, whose Redemption all does free,
Son of the Father, who alone
Before the World began to be,
Didst spring from Him by Means unknown;

Thou his clear Brightness, thou his Light,
Thou everlasting Hope of all,
Observe the Prayers which in Thy Sight
Thy Servants through the World let fall.

O dearest Saviour, bear in Mind
That of our Body Thou a Child
Didst whilom take the natural Kind,
Born of the Virgin undefiled.

This much the present Day makes known,
Passing the Circuit of the Year,
