But o! when it approached that' impaled Court,
Where Mars himself envied his future glory
And whither he in arms did oft resort;
My heart conceived a right Tragick story.
Whither, Great Prince, o, whither dost thou go?
(Me thought the very place thus seemed to say)
Why in black Robes art thou attended so?
Do not, o do not make such hast away.
But art thou captive, and in triumph too?
Oh me! and worse too, liveless, breathless, dead.
How could the Monster-Death this mischief do?
Surely the Coward took thee in thy bed.
    For while that thou art armed within my list,
    He dared not meet thee Like a Martialist.
