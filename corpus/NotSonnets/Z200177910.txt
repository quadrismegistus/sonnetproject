Let such on custards and fine cakes be fed
And we, plain country Bards, eat barley bred.

You court the favours of the town,
You carry verses up and down,
    You scribble for the stage -- 
Who would pursue so poor a trade,
Such debts of honour, badly paid
    For many a laboured prize?
To steer a boat, or drive a cart,
To practice some mechanic art,
    Yields something for your pain;
But poems are in no demand,
Few read them, fewer understand
    The visions of your brain.
