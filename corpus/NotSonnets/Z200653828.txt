If in the Body-politic you see
Rebellion, rapine, bloodshed, anarchy,
That state you say is lost! So when you find
The body human with distempered mind,
The blood corrupted, and the fever high,
You doubt not to pronounce -- that man must die.

    Now in the way of Fable we'll suppose
Rebellion in the human frame arose;
Each member loudly sounded forth his merit,
And cried, to' obey the Head showed want of spirit,
'Twas time the Limbs should now assert their part,
And overturn the empire of the Heart.

    The stubborn Knees declared no more they bend
For God or King, nor any strength would lend
