Where poems, love also;
Where love, likewise magic
With powers indomitable,
Powers inexpendable,
Seasoned in love.

Whence come all true poems,
Their power and their magic
Of two souls as one?
From slow recognition
Of bodies entranced.

Which entrancement of bodies
Will rise from no impulse
To blind propagation,
But claim recognition
