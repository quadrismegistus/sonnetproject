When hostile circumstance
By thunder, sleet or hail
Turns the sun's radiance
Into a coat of mail,
Ironies of the self,
On you I rely
To cut the loss by half
Of that clear sky,
And to restore the place
Of Adam's dream
Where Eve would walk with grace
In the direct beam.
What though the scales are tipped
Darkly the other way,
