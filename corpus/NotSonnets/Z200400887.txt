"Christ pleas√®d not Himself;" the Master's lore,
Bowed at His feet, full well the servant learned;
For in his breast a strong pure love there burned,
That for unlovely souls but glowed the more.
Full many a wounded lamb he homeward boar,
As all night long he paced the desolate street,
Winning, with love most patient, far-strayed feet
From the dark paths that they had known before.
Keen-eyed to judge, in action quick and sure,
No trumpet-blower, scorning all display,
Of simple life, a brother of the poor;
Yet had he genial mood and store of mirth,
And all the poor lads loved his kindly sway,
And knew they had one friend upon the earth.
