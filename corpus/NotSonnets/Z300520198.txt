Brothers, from the icy forges,
    Where the Russian winter's hold
Evermore their cruel orgies,
    Hammering out the killing cold -- 
Hammering out the lives of mortals
    Trodden low by iron heel,
Driven from the tyrant's portals
    Friendless to the friendlier steel;
Put no faith in prince, or others
    Who would trade upon your ill,
Only wait -- are we not brother's? -- 
        We are waiting still.

Patient be, and measures bolder
    Cast with rich and ruddy seed,
