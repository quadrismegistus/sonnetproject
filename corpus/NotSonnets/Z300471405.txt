Behold these woods, and mark my Sweet
How all these boughs together meet!
The Cedar his fair arms displays;
And mixes branches with the Baize.
The lofty Pine dains to descend,
And sturdy Oaks do gently bend.
One with another subtly weaves
Into one loom their various leaves;
As all ambitious were to be
Mine and my Phyllis canopy!

Let's enter, and discourse our Loves;
These are, my dear, no telltale groves!
There dwell no Pyes, nor Parrots there,
To prate again the words they hear.
