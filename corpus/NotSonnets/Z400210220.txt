Lilienthal said  :  I herd him saying words Like these.
Almost Like these words:
My convictions are not so much against, as for.
I believe -- and I conceive law to rest here, as does religion -- 
The fundamental truth, the integrity of the individual;
That all we built be designed to promote and protect and
defend
The integrity and the dignity of the individual.
This the essential meaning of our nation,
As it is essentially the meaning of religion.

Any forms, then, which make men means rather than ends,
Which exalt any institution above the importance of men,
Which rest on and arbitrary power over men,
Are contrary to that conception and my meaning.
