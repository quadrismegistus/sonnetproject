Concerning of the Cross my faith is this
It is amiss, to such as mak't amiss.
To such as reverence it or do adore it,
Or say their prayers to it or before it.
Such do pervert it from its proper use,
And turn and ornament, to and abuse.
We use no cross in Baptisme, with intent
To add some virtue to the Sacrament:
Nor is it used at all, by any one
Untill the Child be baptised, and alls done.
Turks, Pagans, Heathens, Infidels, and Jews,
They know not Christ, therefore no Cross they use,
But no true Christian, justly can repine
To let a Cross stand, as a Christian sign.
