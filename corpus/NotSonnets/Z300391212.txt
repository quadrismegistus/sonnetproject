How sweet to mark the softened ray,
O'er the ocean lightly play;
Now no more the billows rave,
Clear and tranquil is the wave;
While I view the vessel glide,
O'er the calm cerulean tide.

Now might fays, and fairy bans,
Assemble on these "yellow sands;"
For this the hour, as poets tell,
That oft they leave the flowery cell,
And led the sportive dance along,
While spirits pour the choral sung.

The moonbeam sheds a lustre pale,
And trembles on the distant sail;
