A Curious Knot God made in Paradise,
    And drew it out inamled neatly Fresh.
It was the True-Love Knot, more sweet than spice
    And set with all the flowers of Graces dress.
    Its Weddens Knot, that never can be untied.
    No Alexanders Sword can it divide.

The slips here planted, gay and glorious grow:
    Unless and Hellish breath do sing their Plumes.
Here Primrose, Cowslips, Roses, Lilies blow
    With Violets and Pinkes that void perfumes.
    Whose beauteous leaves over laid with Hony Due.
    And Chanting birds Cherp out sweet Music true.

When in this Knot I planted was, my Stock
    Soon knotted, and a manly flower out brake.
