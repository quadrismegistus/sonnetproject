Happy man that all his days hath spent
VVithin his own grounds, and no farther went;
VVhom the same house that did him erst behold
A little Infant, sees him now grown old;
That with his staff walks where he crawled before,
Counts th'age of one poor cottage and no more.
Fortune never him with various tumult pressed,
Nor drank he unknown streams, a wandering guest.
He feared no Merchant's storms, nor drums of war,
Nor ever knew the strifes of the hoarse Bar.
VVho though to next Town he a stranger be,
Yet heavens sweet prospect he enjoys more free.
From fruits, not Consuls, computation brings,
By Apples Autumns knows, by flowers the springs.
