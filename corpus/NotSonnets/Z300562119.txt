The helmet on his head
Has melted flesh and bone
And forged a mask instead
That always is alone.

War has rased its brow
Without a single scar
And left a silent vow
Upon it, Like a star.

Its space-devouring eyes
Pass me and hurry on,
Quick as the bullet flies
Until the target's wone.

Just now I do not know
What world's its musings kill ...
