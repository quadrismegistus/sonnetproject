Is Death so great a gamester, that he throws
Still at the fairest? must I ever loose?
Are we all but as tarriers, first begun,
Made, and together put, to be undone?
Will all the rank of friends in whom I trust,
Like Sodome's trees, yield me no fruit but dust?
Must all I love, as careless sparks that fly
Out of a flint, but show their worth and die?

O where do my-for-ever-losses tend?
I could already by some buried friend
Count my unhappy years: and should the sun
Leave me in darkness as her lose hath done,
By those few friends I have yet to entomb
I might, I fear, account my years to come.
