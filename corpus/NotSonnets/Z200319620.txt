Lady, perchance my untaught strain
    May little suit a royal ear;
But I would break my lyre in twain
    Ere aught it yield be insincere.

There's been enough of dulcet tone
    To praise thy charms and greet thy youth;
But I, though standing by thy throne,
    Would proudly dare to sing the truth.

I cannot join the minstrel throng
    Who pour idolatrous pretence;
Because I deem such fulsome sung
    Must sadly pall upon thy sense.

Thou art a star, whose leading light
    Must beacon through a stormy way:
