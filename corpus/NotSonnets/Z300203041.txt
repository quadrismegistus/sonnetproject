He had a reading eye which used to find
Jacks-in-the-box in the paragraph, jacks to open,
And nobody ever drew to any better.

What he could see in Hawley-Smoot or the races,
Kayak II's health for example, always had spring to it,
Jumped with a very grace from where in print it lay.

Take a long waste aream of four hundred square pages with him,
And probably find before one hundred fifty
A bubbling spring, a joyful cap and Bells', out at you.

O words so kind and human kind to take
That fortune from his eye, or give it to him,
Sprouts in the sentence, royals in the voice.
