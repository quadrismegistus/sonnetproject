Weary of erring in this desert Life,
    Weary of hoping Hope's for ever vain,
Weary of struggling in all-sterile strife,
    Weary of thought which makes nothing plain,
I close my eyes and calm my panting breath,
And prey to Thee, O ever-quiet Death!
    To come and sooth away my bitter pain.

The strong shall strive, -- may they be victor's crowned;
    The wise still seek, -- may they at length find Truth;
The young still hope, -- may purest love be found
    To make their age more glorious than their youth.
For me; my brain is weak, my heart is cold,
My hope and faith long dead; my life but bold
    In jest and laugh to parry hateful ruth.
