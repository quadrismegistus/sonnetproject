My great brother
Lord of the Song
wears the ruff of
forest bear.

Husband, thy fleece of silk is black,
a black adornment;
lies so close to the turns of the flesh,
burns my palm-stroke.

My great brother
Lord of the Song
wears the ruff of
forest bear.

Strong legs of our son are dusted
dark with hair.
