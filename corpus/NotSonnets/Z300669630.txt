Thus did the ancient artist-soul arrest
    A perfect thought and model it for me,
    A truth in stone, to face eternity.
Lips turned to lips they stand, and breast to breast;
The fingers of his right hand lightly rest
    On her dear cheek, his left hand lovingly
    Holding her head -- so stand they, he and she -- 
Her arms about his naked body pressed.

These are the gods I worship, even these,
    The body and soul of Nature, girl and boy
For ever young; I fall upon my knees
    And worship them. Pure life without alloy!
Spirit and flesh made one; and so each frees
    The other. Perfect Love and perfect Joy!
