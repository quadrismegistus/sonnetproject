Walking I chanced into a shade,
Which top-in-twining trees had made
    Of many several kinds.
There grew the high aspiring Elm,
With boughs bathing in gum-like balm,
    Distilling through their rinds.
The Maple with a skarry skin
    Did spread broad pallid leaves:
The quaking Aspine light and thin
    To that' air light passage gives:
        Resembling still
        The trembling ill
Of tongues of womankind,
        Which never rest,
