'Tis said that men are equal, and that birth
And rank and genius, in this thing of earth,
Are but the babbles that the fools believe,
The cunning proffer, and the dupes receive!
Sometimes I've thought so in this world of toys, -- 
Solid in sorrows, -- light alone in joys: -- 
At least of birth and rank I've often seen
Vice in the heart, and baseness in the mien!
Where is the worth of those we call the great, -- 
Conclaves of highborn title, office, state?
Tools of intriguers, ignorant of right,
Reckless in justice, obstinate in spite;
Open to trifles children would discard, -- 
To truth, when most it blazes, dull and hard;
