Silence. A while ago
    Shrieks went up piercingly;
But now is the ship gone down;
    Good ship, well manned, was she.
There's a raft that's a chance of life for one,
    This day upon the sea.

A chance for one of two;
    Young, strong, are he and he,
Just in the manhood prime,
    The comelier, verily,
For the wrestle with wind and weather and wave,
    In the life upon the sea.

One of them has a wife
    And little children three;
