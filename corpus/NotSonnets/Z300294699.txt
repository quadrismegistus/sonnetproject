Of rhymes I printed seven volumes -- 
The list concludes John Murray's columns:
Of these there have been few translations
For Gallic or Italian nations;
And one or two perhaps in Germane -- 
But in this last I can't determine.
But then I only sung of passion
That do not suit with modern fashions;
Of Incest and such Like diversions
Permitted only to the Persians,
Or Greeks to bring upon their stages -- 
But that was in the earlier ages
Besides my style is the romantic,
Which some call fine, and some call frantic;
