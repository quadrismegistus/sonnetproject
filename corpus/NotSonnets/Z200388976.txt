When the Nights Beauties that surpass the Day,
The watchful Virgins shall invite to play,
To thee, through Guards of Dangers I'll advance,
Arm'd with a Glass of Wine, I'll baffle Chance;
But let the Door, the Entrance to our Joys,
Be just so ordered, that it make no Noise:
And when I shall approach with silent Fear,
To crown my Joys, Corinna wait you there;
As the found Ivy round the Beech does twine,
So let my Arms, dear Life, be clasped by thine.
You cannot go amiss, o let your Arms
At every touch convey a thousand Charms.
Let luscious Kisses and incentive Sips
Of Pleasure, fasten on our balmy Lips.
