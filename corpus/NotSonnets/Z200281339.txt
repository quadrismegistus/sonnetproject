Immortal Muse, Essential Truth, display
Thy Heav'nly Beams, and whelm me over with Day:
Give Force proportioned to my hardy Aim,
And kindle in my Veins Celestial Flame,
While I approach that' Almighty's blissful Throne,
And make in sacred Verse his high Perfections known
        Hail Great I Am!
The First and Last, Unchangeably the same.
Thou Rock of Ages, Thy Exalted Head,
    With Clouds and awful Darkness spread,
Unshaken by the rolling Floods of Time,
Above Duration's Deep ascends sublime.
Thy undecaying Vigour ever reigns,
And still Thy Arm Almighty Strength retains.
