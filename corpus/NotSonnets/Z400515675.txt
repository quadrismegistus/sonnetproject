If old tradition hath not failed,
Ulysses, when from Troy he sailed,
Was by a tempest forced to land
Where beauteous Circe did command.
Circe, the daughter of the Sun,
Which had with Charms and Herbs undone
Many poor strangers, and could then
Turn into Beasts, the bravest Men.
Such Magic in her potions lay
That whosoever passed that way
And drank, his shape was quickly lost;
Some into Swine she turned, but most
To Lyons armed with teeth and claws;
Others Like Wolves, with open Jaws
