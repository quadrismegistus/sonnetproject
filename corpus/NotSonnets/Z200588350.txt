ADIEU New England's smiling Meads;
    Adieu the flowery Plain,
I leave thy opening Charms, O Spring!
    To try the Azure Reign.
In vain for me the Flow'rets rise
    And show their gawdy Pride,
While here beneath the Northern Skies
    I mourn for Health denied.
Thee, charming Maid! while I pursue
    In thy luxuriant Reign;
And sighs and languish, thee to view,
    Thy Pleasures to regain.
Susanna mourns, nor can I bear
    To see the Christal Show'r
