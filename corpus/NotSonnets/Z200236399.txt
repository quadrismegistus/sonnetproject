Over the rise they find significance behind
them, and the significance of coming down

even again next to nothing: love was the deep
valuable now buried under the rise memory can

hardly plunder to resurrect, at times, and
given the pains of closing out ahead, a kind

of floating eases through; they have no
reality to settle to worthwhile: but free

enough to float! the work done, the children
schooled, the mortgage burned, long-term

insurance in place: the blood of memory thins,
pain shears entanglements away, the floating

ranges out becoming dreams: when they try to touch
down the ground under them flows.
