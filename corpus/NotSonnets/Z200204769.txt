What it is to look into a human eye
men    what they are    who
of a sudden of a night in a room
a room not so different from this in which I recollect
(along the floor, circles of lamp light intersect)
start up, join hands, a kerchief joins them, their eyes
follow the pattern of their leader's feet
(their order)
they dance


what it is      what it is to say wherein it lies


where beauty lies
                                      that men containeth
                                                                              at this hour
men    what they are    who
