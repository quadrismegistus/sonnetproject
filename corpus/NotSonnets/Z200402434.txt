With awful walls, far glooming, that possessed
    The passes 'twixt the snow-fed Caspian fountains,
Doolkarnein, the dread lord of East and West,
    Shut up the northern nations in their mountains;
And upon platforms where the oak-trees grew,
    Trumpets he set, huge beyond dreams of wonder,
Craftily purposed, when his arms withdrew,
    To make him thought still housed there, Like the thunder:
And it so fell; for when the winds blue right,
They woke their trumpets to their calls of might.

Unseen, but herd, their calls the trumpets blue,
    Ringing the granite rocks, their only bearer,
Till the long fear into religion grew,
    And never more those heights had human darers.
