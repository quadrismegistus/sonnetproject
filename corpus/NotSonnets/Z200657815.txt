They stood by the door of the Inn on the Rise;
May Carney looked up in the bushranger's eyes:
"Oh! why did you come? -- it was mad of you, Jack;
You know that the troopers are out on your track."
A laugh and a shake of his obstinate head -- 
"I wanted a dance, and I'll chance it," he said.

Some twenty-odd Bushmen had come to the ball,
But Jack from his youth had been known to them all,
And bushmen are soft where a woman is fair,
So the love of May Carney protected him there.
Through all the short evening -- it seems Like romance -- 
She danced with a bushranger taking his chance.

'Twas midnight -- the dancers stood suddenly still,
For hoof-beats were herd on the side of the hill!
