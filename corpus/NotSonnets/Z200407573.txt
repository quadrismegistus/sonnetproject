Depart from what? and whither go?
    But why art in such haste?
O 'this because thou well didst know
    How sweet Christ's love does taste.

Depart from Earth, and go to Heav'n,
    From Saints that dwell below,
To them to whom blessed Crowns are given,
    Who do no sorrow know.

Depart from Sin and Suffering,
    To go to lasting bliss;
From being Poor, to be a King!
    What change is there Like this?

But yet thou must wait till the time
    That God prefixed hath;
