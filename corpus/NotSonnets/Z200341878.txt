Child, with fresh cheek upon thy velvet palm,
O bright-haired child, That sleep is sweet and calm -- 
Through all those youthful pulses breathing balm;
            But yet I say, Arise!
        The unexhausted night hangs damp -- 
        Black yet round each unwaning lamp;
        Against the echoing casement-pane,
        Driving raw cold and plangent rain,
            The wind of Autumn sighs.
        Yet from that flowerlike rest, through all,
        Rough gales that blow, chill showers that fall,
            I say again, Arise!
        This once let sleep depart, for lo!
        The hour that seals a nation's woe
