Happy man whom God does aid!
God our soul and body made,
God on us in gracious showers
Blessings every moment pours;
Compasses with angel-bands,
Bids them bear us in their hands:
Parents, friends, 'it God bestowed;
Life, and all, descends from God.

He this flowery carpet spread,
Made the earth on which we tread,
God refreshes in the air,
Covers with the clothes we wear,
Feeds us in the food we eat,
Cheers us by the light and heat,
