March, march, march away, pretty ones,
    See where the road to distinction's before you;
March, march, country and city ones,
    Follow the lass that will led you to glory.

On with the pretty coat -- off with the petticoat,
    Stays and tight-lacing no longer shall tease us;
Cast away all clothes for jacket and small clothes,
    And heigh for a peep into Peloponnesus!
        March, march, etc.

Come then, sweet damsels, all sorts and all sizes,
    Maids, widows, wives, "unequivocals," come!
Think, only think, girls, how glorious the prize is;
    Up with the musket and follow the drum!
Equal in bustle men -- down with the Mussulmen;
