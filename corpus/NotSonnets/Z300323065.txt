Thy mansion is the Christian's heart,
    O Lord, thy dwelling-place secure!
Bid the unruly throng depart,
    And leave the consecrated door.

Devoted as it is to thee,
    A thievish swarm frequents the place;
They steal away my joys from me,
    And rob my Saviour of his praise.

There, too, a sharp designing trade
    Sin, Satan, and the World maintain;
Nor cease to press me, and persuade
    To part with ease, and purchase pain.

I know them, and I hate their din;
    Am weary of the bustling crowd;
