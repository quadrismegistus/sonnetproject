God bless our lovely Queen,
With cloudless days serene;
    God save our Queen.
From perils, pangs and woes,
Secret and open foes,
Till her last evening close,
    God save our Queen.

From flattery's poisoned streams;
From faction's fiendish schemes,
    God shield our Queen;
With men her throne surround,
Firm, active, zealous, found,
Just, righteous, sage, profound;
    God save our Queen.
