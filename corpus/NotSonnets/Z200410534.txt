I love the Lord, and am well pleased,
    He hath me herd, and eased.
Whilst therefore life continue shall,
    I will upon Him call.
The snares of death about me dwelled,
    And pains of Hell I felt.
Disturbed thoughts, and heaviness
    My conscience did oppress.

Then to the Lord my plaint I made,
    And thus unto Him said:
O Lord! my soul from falling save,
    And lift me from the grave.
The Lord is gracious, and just,
    To those His mercy trust:
