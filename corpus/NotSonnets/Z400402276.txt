Thy name, O God, is wondered,
    though we the same abuse,
And by thy name such things are done,
    as make the mind to muse.
The heavens above, the earth below,
    and waters under them,
Thy name hath wrought miraculously,
    all for the use of men.
O marvelous God what is thy name?
    or what shall I thee call;
Thou art in power omnipotent,
    the mightiest power of all.
Then mighty powers of powers that is,
    vouchsafe the same in me;
