A hungry Tyrant, whose oppressive Reign
Did many ways his Subject's Purses drain;
Was of a Wealthy Virtuoso told,
(And that was strange) who wallowed in his Gold:
Him he resolved to squeeze, among the rest:
And, since Sir Gim-crack mighty Feats professed,
Enjoin'd him (with design to make him Bleed)
Soundly to Fine, or teach and Ass to Read.

The Spark, who knew Refusal was a Crime,
Said, That could only be the Work of Time;
But if his Grace would Twenty Years allow,
To try Experiments what Art could do;
He durst engage, his Pupil, by his Care,
Shou'd Read as well as any Clerk at Bar.
