Chains, and a haughty Fair I fearless view!
Hope's of paternal Freedom all adieu.
Ah when will Love compassionate my Woes?
In one sad Tenour my Existence flows:
Whether I kiss or bite the galling Chain,
Alike my Pleasure, and alike my Pain.
I burn, I burn! o banish my Despair!
Oh ease my Torture, too too cruel Fair:
Rather than feel such vast, such matchless Woe,
I'ld rise some Rock overspread with endless Snow!
Or frown a Cliff on some disastrous Shore,
Where Ships are wrecked, and Tempests ever roar!

In pensive Gloominess I pass the Night,
Nor feel Contentment at the Dawn of Light.
