Some may esteem those Beauties most Divine
    That dressed in sparkling Di'monds shine;
    Whose precious Rays are proudly shown
To give new Lustre, which conceal their own.

The Ropes of Pearl those meaner Beauties wear,
    Proclaim them rather Rich, than Fair;
    False Lights their tarnished Forms disguise,
And Jewels glitter to reproach their Eyes.

Jewels Like numerous Stars set in the Sky,
    May from a spangled Galaxy,
    May gild the Clouds, and make them bright.
But, when the Stars appear, we own 'this Night.

Tho' on the Moor his Flames bright Ph≈ìbus throws,
    Yet swarthy Night deforms his Brows,
