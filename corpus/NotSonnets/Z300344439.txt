Hence the world! -- and sleep my muse!
So will I stroll, wherever I choose;
Roll in my chariot over the seas;
Or ride a broomstick, if I please;
Breakfast with gods, and take my dinner
With any saint, or any sinner;
And sup at eve, to kill the spleen,
With Mab, my little fairy-queen.

'Tis done; -- and sleep has bound my eyes;
 -- 'Tis done; and now the vision flies:
For, 'this not given me to be long,
To speak the mysteries of my sung.
Listen you young, and listen old,
And try the vision to unfold.
