Says my father, says he, one day to I,
    Thou knowest by false friends we are undone,
Shou'd my lawsuit be lost, then thy good fortune try
    Among our relations in London:

Here's Sukey, the poor orphan child of friend Grist,
    Who once kept thy father from starving,
When thy fortune thou'st made, thou shalt take by the fist,
    For a wife, for she's good and deserving:

But mind thee in heart this one maxim, our Jack,
    As thou'st read thy good fate in a book, -- 
Make honour thy guide, or else never come back
    To Father, and Mother, and Suke.

So I bussed Suke and mother, and greatly concerned,
    Off I set, with my father's kind blessing,
