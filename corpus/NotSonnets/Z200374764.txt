My dear Castara, tother day
I herd and ancient Shepherd say,
Alas for me! my time draws nigh,
And shortly, shortly I must die!
What meant the man? for lo! apace
Torrents of tears ran down his face.

Poor harmless Maid! why wouldst thou know,
What known, must needs create thee woe?
'Twill cloud the Sunshine of thy days,
And in thy soul such trouble raise,
Thou'lt grieve, and tremble, and complain,
And say that all thy beauty's vain.

Ah me! sure 'this some dreadful thing
That can so great disorder bring,
