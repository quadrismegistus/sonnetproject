Jehovah to my words give ear
        My meditation weigh
    The voice of my complaining hear
My King and God for unto thee I prey.
    Jehovah thou my early voice
        Shalt in the morning hear
    Ith' morning I to thee with choice
Will rank my Prayers, and watch till thou appear.
    For thou art not a God that takes
        In wickedness delight
    Evil with thee no biding makes
Fools or mad men stand not within thy sighed.
    All workers of iniquity
        Thou hatest; and them unblest
