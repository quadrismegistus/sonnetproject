A sinner's heart by lust possessed,
Of birds unclean the loathsome nest,
    Of fiends the dark abided;
A stinking sepulchre it lies,
While the poor wretch with horror flies
    The sighed of man and God.

Shut up within himself he dwells,
Corruption, rottenness, conceals,
    Till the Deliverer come:
Tormented then with sudden light
The slave of hell bewrays his fright,
    And rushes from his tomb.

Jesus, Thy Spirit drags him thence,
Compell'd by Thine omnipotence
