Whatever Savage Boar shall graze around
The level Plain, or seek the Woodland Ground;
I charge you not to hurt my Favourite Boy,
Nor for the Fight your whetted Tusks employ.
May Guardian Love himself the Youth defend,
Danger avert, and all his Steps attend:
Oh! may Diana, and her Virgin Train,
Forbear the Pastimes of the sportive Plain.
Fade the fresh Verdure of the Forest Grounds,
And fail the opening Dogs, and swift-foot Hounds.

What Madness is it various Toils to lay,
T'enclose the woody Hills, and bushy Way;
Stretching thy Snares across the rugged Lands,
While clinging Brambles raze thy Blood-stain'd Hands;
