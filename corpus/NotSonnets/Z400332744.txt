Thou Sacred Power! favouring, receive whatever
Of Spices we in odorous Heaps prefer!
While waiting at thy Shrine Sulpicia stands,
And loads thy Altars with her snowy Hands.
Thee to adore, the due observant Fair,
Is dressed with curious Art and nicest Care:
Yet though she honours thee with Rites Like these,
There's one in secret she desires to please.

And you, O! Goddess, grant their Flame may last,
And equal Fetters to Cerinthus cast:
With such united Force secure their Love,
That none may that' unaltered Charm remove:
May no new Beauty influence his Eye,
Nor she for any Youth in secret Sighs;
