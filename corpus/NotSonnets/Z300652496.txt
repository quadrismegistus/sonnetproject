When Brennus came back here from Rome,
    These words he is said to have spoken:
"We have conquered, my boys! and brought home
    A sprig of the vine for a token!
Cheer, my hearties! and welcome to Gaul
    This plant, which we wone from the foeman;
'Tis enough to repay us for all
    Our trouble in beating the Roman;
        Bless the gods, and bade luck to the geese!

O! take care to treat well the fair guest,
    From the blasts of the north to protect her;
Of your hillocks, the sunniest and best
    Make them hers, for the sake of her nectar.
She shall nurse your young Gauls with her juice;
