Come on, my brave fellows, a fig for our lives
    We'll fight for our country, our children and wives.
Determin'd we are to live happy and free;
    Then join honest fellows in chorus with me.
Derry down, down, &c.

We'll drink our own liquour, our brandy from peaches,
    A fig for the English, they may kiss all our breeches.
Those bloodsucking, beer-drinking puppies retreat;
    But our peach-brandy fellows can never be beat.
Derry down, down, &c.

A fig for the English, and Hessians to boot,
    Who are sick half their time with eating of crout,
But bacon and greens, and Indian corn-bread,
    Make a buckskin jump up, though' he seem to be dead.
