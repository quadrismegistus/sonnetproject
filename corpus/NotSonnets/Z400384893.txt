Sooner the olive shall provoke
To amorous clasp's this sturdy oak,
And doves in league with eagles be,
Ere I will glance a smile on thee.

Sooner, yond dustish mulberry
In her old white shall clothed be,
And lizards with fierce asps combine,
Ere I will twist my soul with thine.

Yet art thou in my judgement far
Fairer then a rising star,
And might deserve even Diana's love
But shalt not Tetricezza move.

And thou art sweeter then the down
Of damast-roses yet unblown,
