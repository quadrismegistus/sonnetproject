The Vines of Lebanon that briskly grew
    Roses of Sharon in their flourish fair,
The Lillies of the Vallies Beauteous show
    And Carmels Glorious Flowery Robes most rare
    In all their lively looks blushed brisk, appear
    Dull Wan looked things, Lord, to thy Gardens gear.

Engedi's Vineyard, that brave Camphire bower,
    The Cypress Banks and Beds of bravery
And Eshcol's Grapes that royal juice out shower,
    And Wine of Hesbon in its flavor high
    With Elevating Sparks stand shrinking, blush
    To see the flourish of thy Garden flush.

Mount Olivet with Olive Trees full green,
    The flourishing Almonds in their smiling ray
