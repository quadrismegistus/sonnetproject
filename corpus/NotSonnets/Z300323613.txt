Near forty years with all my Care and Skill,
Dear Flock, I fed you, as I feed you still.
Tho' mine at first was but the Curate's fare -- 
Half full the Belly, and the Back half bore -- 
Yet, freed from College Rules and classic Song,
The light Heart laughed and the young hope rose strong,
And (wrapped in visions of preferment) found
No Grief in Want and from Contempt no wound.
In pride and pity when the Farmer gave
A Sunday's Dinner to the Vicar's slave,
And more than hinted from my languid Looks,
I fed the Six remaining Days on Books:
Patient I [stared], and saw through' rolling years
His tithed Sheaf humble through' its golden Ears;
