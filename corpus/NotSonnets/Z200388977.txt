Leave, wretched Hawkshaw, leave
Thy self with airy Fantoms to deceive;
    There's no such thing as Love,
Except it be amongst the Gods above;
    'Tis and Empty Noise of Air,
Whose Echo brings back nothing but Despair.

    'Tis a Lottery of Care,
Wherein ten thousand Blanks, few Prizes are:
    And yet so mad are we,
We hazard all at this poor Vanity;
    And commonly it happens so,
We're cheated of our Time and Mony too.

    Let's at another's Cost be wise;
Poor Cowley ran, and yet never wone the Prize,
