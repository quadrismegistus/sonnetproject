Cease, Cvtty, cease, to feed these simple Flockes,
And for a Trumpet change thine Oaten-reeds;
O're-looke the valleys as aspiring rocks,
And rather march in steel then shepherd's weeds.
Beleeue me, Cvtty! for heroic deeds
Thy verse is fit, not for the lives of Swaines,
(Though both thou canst do well) and none proceeds
To leave high pitches for the lowly plains:
    Take thou a Harp in hand, strive with Apollo;
    Thy Muse was made to led, then scorn to follow.

Willy, to follow sheep I never shall scorn,
Much less to follow any Deity;
Who 'gainst the Sun (though weakened by the morn)
Would vie with looks, needs and Eagles eye,
