Amintas! (who our northern fields makest proud;
Whose Eye, then Ph≈ìbus more prevents that cloud,
Now, from the Southeast threatening,) ah, how long?
How many Summers since thy glorious Song
Our Air enriched! grown foggy, since the time
Strephon contending, in and humble Rhime,
His Silvia praised, to thy Vrbana&supere;'s Eyes.
Dear Shepherd, now, (if our Societies
Seeme not unworthy thee) that pipe assay,
Which has made Short ev&supere;n the Longest Daye.

Damon, that Pipe is broke, and Numbers now
Amintas can no more; my Braine and Brow
Is but one Cloud; if, Damon, I may hear
Thy better Notes, I lend a willing Eare.
