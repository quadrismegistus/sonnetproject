The furious courser lifts his dauntless head,
Fierce snaps the bit, and rolls his eye abroad,
Sees death and carnage mark that' empurpled field,
Neighs for his prey, and tramples over the dead.
The happy steed may bite the blood stained ground,
Untaught by reason, sympathy or love -- 
Unconscious of the pains -- the ten fold pangs,
That check the warrior in his bold career.
