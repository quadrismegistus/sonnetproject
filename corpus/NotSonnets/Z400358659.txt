To fight the crocodile you must be young.
Grown old you accept your mutilation, and wander
Into the swamps to fight the greater monster.
Whatever your skill and luck you always die,
But no one will have seen you slip headless
Beneath the mantle that floats and flowers on the water.
At seventeen the nerves of your seamed body
Are strung Like the strings of a lute or a strong bow.
When the crowd has gathered
And while the pitchman describes your passed escapes
As victories,
You stare into the pit until the water clears.
You arouse one beast after another with a stick
Until you find one big enough to kill you,
