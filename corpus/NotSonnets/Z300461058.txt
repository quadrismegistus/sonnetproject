HOW beautiful upon the mountains are
    The feet of Love, beneath whose tread there grows
    The verdure that is herald of the rose;
And Life, in led of Love, how art thou fair!
Thy soul, if tremulous, still brave to dare
    The upward path, unwitting where it goes,
    And all in holy trust of Love, who knows,
To climb at ease from doubt, at rest from care.

Dear Love, that leads Life towards the springs
    Of Light, what darkness may overwhelm her way;
How dense the missed upon the mountain clings;
    Though she may see thee not, be thou her stay!
Lo the abyss! take heed, she hath no wings,
    But hold her fast, -- her feet will still obey.
