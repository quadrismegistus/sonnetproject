All is well -- in a prison -- tonight, and the warders are crying "All's Well!"
I must speak, for the sake of my heart -- if it's but to the walls of my cell.
For what does it matter to me if tomorrow I go where I will?
I am free, as I never was free -- there is nought in my life to fulfil.

Are the fields of my fancy less fair through a window that's narrow and barred?
Are the morning stars dimmed by the glare of the gaslight that flares in the yard?
I am free! I am haunted no more by the question that tortured my brain:
Was I sane, of a people gone mad -- or mad, in a world that is sane?

I've had time to recover, and prey -- and my reason no longer is vexed
By the spirit that hangs you one day, and would hail you as martyr the next;
Yet I found in my raving a balm -- in the worst that had come to the worst;
Let me think of it all. I grow calm; let me think it all out from the first.

Beyond the horizon of Self the bore walls of my prison retreat,
And I stand in a gap of the hills with the scene of my life at my feet;
