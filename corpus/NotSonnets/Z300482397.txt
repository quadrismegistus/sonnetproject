This evening's shade no mirth, no joy beguiles,
    Beneath that roof, fair Catherine's home so long;
Grief, ill concealed, in forced and transient smiles,
    Sits on each heart, and falters on each tongue.

Yes, Harper, even on thine; -- since, if thy brow
    From Nature's hand its candid traits obtained,
Thou hast and heart to feel for all who know,
    And love and loose the treasure thou hast gained.

Long on your mutual fate, that every star
    Propitious to the weal of life may shine,
Still shall my soul implore, when distant far
    From her, whose hand, and vows, and heart are thine,
Oft as her from shall to my memory rise,
And wake, with kindest wishes, selfish sighs.
