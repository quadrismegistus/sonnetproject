It shall not grieve me (friend) though what I write
Be held no wit at Court. If I delight
So far my sullen Genius, as to raise
It pleasure; I have money, wine, and bays
Enough to crown me Poet. Let those wits,
Who teach their Muse the art of Parasits
To win on easy greatness; or the yongue
Spruce Lawyer who's all impudence and tongue
Sweat to divulge their fame's: thereby the one
Gets fees; the other hire, I 'me best unknown:
Sweet silence I embrace thee, and thee Fate
Which didst my birth so wisely moderate;
That I by want am neither vilified,
Nor yet by riches flattered into pride.
