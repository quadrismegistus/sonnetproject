Astery, why do you bewail
        Him, whom the zephyrs shall restore,
    Which fill with vernal breath the sail,
        Wafting Bithynian wealth on shore,
The happy Gyges, whose fair truth is known,
And constancy has made so much your own?
    He, driven by that autumnal [Footnote: 1Kb] goat
        And southern winds, is forced away,
    His meditations to devote
        On fair Astery night and day,
And joyless, sleepless, spends the year,
With many a melancholy tear.
    And yet the busy footman speeds
        And many a subtle art he tries,
