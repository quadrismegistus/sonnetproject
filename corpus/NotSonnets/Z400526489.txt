Come, Son of Abraham and of God,
    Saviour on the world bestowed,
        To ransom and to bless;
And let our souls, possessed of Thee,
The true complete felicity,
        The sovereign Good, possess.

Thy faithful word and oath we plead:
    Show Thyself the promised Seed,
        The all-redeeming Lord;
And let us in Thy favour find
And in Thy purity of mind
        Our paradise restored.

In this thrice acceptable hour
    Exercise Thy pardoning power,
