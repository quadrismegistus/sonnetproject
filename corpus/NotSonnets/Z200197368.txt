When the Parson wooed me, then
I could never say "Amen!"
When the doctor, -- what a pill!
His addresses made me ill!
When the Lawyer, -- what a pest!
I was -- "non inventus est!"
But o! now the soldier comes,
With "presented arms" to me,
He may -- "Hurrah" -- "Victory!"
What girl in the Parson's whine
E'er discovered aught divine?
When did the Physician's art
Cure the ague of the heart?
Or the Lawyer's habeas move
