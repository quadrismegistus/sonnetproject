Pleasures! away; they please no more.
Friends! are they what they were before?
Loves! they are very idle things,
The best about them are their wings.
The dance! 'this what the bear can do;
Music; I hate your music too.

Whene'er these witnesses that Time
Hath snatched the chaplet from our prime,
Are called by Nature, as we go
With eye more wary, step more slow,
And will be herd and noted down,
However we may fret or frown,
Shall we desire to leave the scene
Where all our former joys have been?
