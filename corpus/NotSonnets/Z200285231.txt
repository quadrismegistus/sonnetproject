We three were loving friends! -- a lowly life
    Of humble peace, obscure content, we led:
Stealing away, withouten noise or strife,
    Like some small streamlet in its mossy bed.

We had our joys in common -- wisdom, wit,
    And learned lore, had little share in those:
Thus, by the winter fire we used to sit,
    Or in the summer evening's warm repose.

At our sweet bowery window, opening down
    To the green grass, beneath the flowering lime,
When the deep curfew from the distant town
    Came mellowed, Like the voice of olden time;

And our grave neighbour, from the barn hard by,
    The great gray owl, sailed out on soundless wings,
