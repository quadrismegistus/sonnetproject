There is a dear delightful hour,
Enchanting, soothing in its power,
    'Tis when the fervid sun
Has shed his fading, lingering rays,
And when the twilight soft betrays,
    That day his course has run.

'Tis when the moon, far over the main,
Sheds on the hill and smiling plain,
    Her pure, yet borrowed beams;
When some pale lover, wandering far,
Beholds the bright Hesperian star,
    In fancy's golden dreams.

'Tis when the raised romantic mind,
To friendship, peace, and heaven resigned,
