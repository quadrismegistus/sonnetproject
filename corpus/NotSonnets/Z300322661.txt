'Tis mighty Wise that you would now be thought
With your grave Rules from musty Morals brought:
Through which some streaks too of Divin'ity ran,
Partly of Monk, and partly Puritan;
With tedious Repetitions too y'ave taken
Often the name of Vanity in vain.
Things, which, I take it, friend, you'd never recite,
Should she I love, but say to' you, Come at night.
The Wisest King refused all pleasures quite,
Till Wisdom from above did him enlight;
But when that gift his ign'orance did remove,
Pleasures he chosen, and placed them all in Love.
And if by 'event the Counsels may be seen,
This wisdom 'it that brought the Southern Queen.
