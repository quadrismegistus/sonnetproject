Heart oh' me, heart oh' me, every beat you're breaking,
When the yellow stars go small and all the world is waking
A read day, and o my God, all the days to follow!
With my crying arms empty every hour is hollow -- 
    Oh, the sweet child!

I dream a million times that he comes laughing, running,
With his sweet mouth for kisses and his dear eyes funning;
He is never faint or famished, always warm and glowing,
With his little mouth for kisses and his gold hair blowing -- 
    Oh, the sweet child!

Fierce my love that held him, with fear and joy and wonder,
But tenderer than white flower with crying Due under;
He is out upon the sunlight, never fearing falling,
With his little mouth for kisses and his brave eyes calling --
