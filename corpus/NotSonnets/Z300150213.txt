The Pagan's myths through marble lips are spoken,
    And ghosts of old Beliefs still flit and moan
Round fane and altar overthrown and broken,
    O'er tree-grown barrow and grey ring of stone.

Blind Faith had martyrs in those old high places,
    The Syrian hill grove and the Druid's wood,
With mother's offering, to the Fiend's embraces,
    Bone of their bone, and blood of their own blood.

Red altars, kindling through that night of error,
    Smoked with warm blood beneath the cruel eye
Of lawless Power and sanguinary Terror,
    Throned on the circle of a pitiless sky;

Beneath whose baleful shadow, overcasting
    All heaven above, and blighting earth below,
