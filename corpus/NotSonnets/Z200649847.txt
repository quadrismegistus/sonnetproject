Thou restless fluctuating Deep,
Expressive of the human Mind,
In thy for ever varying Form,
    My own inconstant Self I find.

How soft now flow thy peaceful Waves,
    In just Gradations to the Shore:
While on thy Brow, unclouded shines
    The Regent of the midnight Hour.

Blessed Emblem of that equal State,
    Which I this Moment feel within:
Where Thought to Thought succeeding rolls,
And all is placid and serene.

As over thy smoothly flowing Tide,
    Their Light the trembling Moon-Beams dart,
