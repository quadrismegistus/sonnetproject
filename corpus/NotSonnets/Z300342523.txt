In sweetest prime and blooming of his Age,
Dear Alcon ravished from this mortal Stage,
The Shepherds mourned as they him loved before:
Among the Rout him Idmon did deplore,
Idmon, who, whither Sun in East did rise
Or dive in West, poured Torrents from his Eyes
Of liquid Chrystall, under Hawthorne shade;
At last to Trees and Rocks this plaint he made:
Alcon, delight of heaven, desire of Earth,
Off-spring of Ph≈ìbus, and the Muses birth,
The Graces Darling, Adonis of our Plains,
Flame of the fairest Nymphs the Earth sustains,
What Power of thee hath us bereft? What Fate
By thy untimely fall would ruinate
