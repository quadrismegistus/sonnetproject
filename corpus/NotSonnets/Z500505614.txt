Thou that hast ever been a roving Thief,
A diving Cutpurse, or a perjured Slaue,
And in all villainy hast been the chief,
And with a brazen brow canst Justice brave,
That stealest thy Pedegree from ancient houses,
And iet'st in broaking Satin every day:
That takest delight in stabbing and Carowses,
Not caring how thou lettest thy lose life stray,
Thou that hast been a Traitor to thy Prince,
A great Arch-villaine to thy Native soil,
And wouldst by treachery exile from thence,
The blessed peace hath been procured with toil.
Thou that hast been a Machiuilian,
For damned sleights, conceits, and policy:
