O green-stoled Nymph, whose fount restored my fair,
    When Sickness cropped the beauty's of her face;
Ne'er may the rainy South thy powers impair,
    May never reptile foul thy stream disgrace.

While on the [Footnote: 1Kb] Tay deep-harrowing Winter reigns,
    Not the least wrinkle may thy surface know;
And while the North binds Earn in icy chains,
    In lapse unfettered may thy waters flow.

May Spring's first cowslips on thy borders bloom;
    Thy banks first echo to the Cuckoo's lay;
First round thee, Fragrance fling each rich perfume;
    Thy thickets first exclude the noontide ray.

What time blithe August on thy margin plays,
    To thee, sweet-featured Nymph, (so Jove ordains)
