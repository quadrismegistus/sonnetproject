What solemn awe pervades my wondering soul,
    While over the deep I cast my straining eye?
Around me, waves on waves, stupendous roll,
    And, mounting, seem to meet the bending sky.

Whether the rosy-fringed dawn I view,
    Purpling the golden east with infant light,
While the read sun yet drinks the falling Due,
    And dissipates the lazy shades of night;

Or whither, mounted in his glittering car,
    He darts meridian splendour over the main;
Or sinking softer down the western air,
    He clothes with crimson clouds that' etherial plain;

The heavens and ocean still my vision bound,
    Nor other object save what they dispense;
