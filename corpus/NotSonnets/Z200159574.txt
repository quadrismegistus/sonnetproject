Composing scales beside the rails
    That flanked a field of corn,
A farmer's boy with vicious joy
    Performed upon a horn:
The vagrant airs, the fragrant airs
    Around that field that strayed,
Took flight before the flagrant airs
    That noisome urchin played.

He played with care "The Maiden's Prayer;"
    He played "God Save the Queen,"
"Die Wacht am Rhein," and "Auld Lang Syne,"
    And "Wearing of the Green:"
With futile toots, and brutal toots,
    And shrill chromatic scales,
