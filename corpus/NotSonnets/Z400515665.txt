What smiling Star in that fair Night,
Which gave you Birth gave me this Sight.
And with a kind Aspect though keen
Made me the Subject: you the Queen?
That sparkling Planet is God now
Into your Eyes, and shines below;
Where nearer force, and more acute
It does dispense, without dispute,
For I who yesterday did know
Loves fire no more, than does cool Snow
with one bright look am since undone;
Yet must adore and seek my Sun.

Before I walked free as the wind,
And if but stayed (Like it,) unkind.
