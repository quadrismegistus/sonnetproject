I sometime think my work is done, and then
Resolved am to lay aside my Pen;
Yet, when I do discover some remain
Unfinished, I take it up again:
For, when I promise, what concerns none
(In any manner) but my self alone,
'Tis always in mine own power, to dispense
With every such Resolve, without offence;
Then, specially, when else, perhaps, I may
To God, my self, or others in some way
Infringe my Duty, by the prosecution
Of that unprofitable Resolution.

For this cause therefore, I now think it fit,
Not only such Resolvings to remit,
