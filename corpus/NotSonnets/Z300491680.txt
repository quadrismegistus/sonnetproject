Dear, let me now this Ev'ning die;
O smile not to prevent it,
But use this opportunity,
Or we shall both repent it.

Frown quickly then and break my heart,
That so my way of dying
May (though my life were full of smart)
Be worth the world's envying.

And now thou frownst, and now I die,
My Corps by Lovers followed,
Which shall by dead Lovers lie.
For that grounds only hallowed.

If Priests tak't ill I have grave,
My death not well approving,
