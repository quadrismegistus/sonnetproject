Wise Emblem of our Politick World,
Sage Snayl, within thine own self curled;
Instruct me softly to make hast,
Whilst these my Feet go slowly fast.

Compendious Snayl! thou seemest to me,
Large Euclids strict Epitome;
And in each Diagram, dost Fling
Thee from the point unto the Ring.
A Figure now Triangulare,
An Oval now, and now a Square;
And then a Serpentine dost crawl
Now a straight Line, now crooked, now all.

Preventing Rival of the Day,
Th'art up and openest thy Ray,
