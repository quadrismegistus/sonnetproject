My dear, Almighty Lord! why dost thou weep?
Why dost thou groan and groan again,
        And with such deep,
    Repeated sighs thy kind heart pain,
    Since the same sacred breath which thus
        Doth Mourn for us,
    Can make men dead and scattered bones
Unite, and raise up all that died, at once?

    O holy groans! Groans of the Dove!
    O healing tears! the tears of love!
    Due of the dead! which makes dust move
And spring, how is't that you so sadly grieve,
        Who can relieve?

Should not thy sighs refrain thy store
