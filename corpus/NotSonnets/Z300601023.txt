They are still there -- how could they fail to be?
The tree loaded with plums, its sage-green fingers
Knuckled on purples, mottle, bobbles of gum,
The pale snail-shells footing the garden wall.
The brass plate by the door at the end of the drive
Polishes itself away summer by summer;
Its shallow letters tell the most perfect strangers
How fiercely a name burned for a few short seasons.
Now such things must be left to be themselves,
Things which have lapsed, which have fallen out of love,
Out of the nets we cast so lightly about them,
Greeting their simple nature's with eyes and fingers.
Signed Like the money-box closed on childish pennies
'For Holidays', 'For Rainy Days, Mine and Others',
