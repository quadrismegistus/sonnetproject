Across the weary waste of billowy water,
    From heaven's high shore,
Comes Christ's voice saying, "O son, O weary daughter,
    Thy toil is over".

Across the moonlit meads, where tremulous willows
    Bend dappled arms;
Across the bright sea's sunlit laughing billows,
    Shine Venus' charms.

But Harken not: think of the skies so golden,
    The seas so sweet,
The glory of him who trod the lake-waves olden
    With unharmed feet.

But we are weary, -- and love's white limbs are shining
    The soft night through;
